# UI Components Implementation - Browser Popups Replacement

## Overview
This implementation replaces browser popups (alert, confirm, window.open) with modern inline UI components to address Firefox compatibility issues and improve user experience.

## Components Created

- **Features**:
  - Full keyboard support (Escape to close, Enter to confirm)
  - Tab trap for accessibility
  - Focus management
  - Backdrop click to close
  - Customizable actions and styling

### 2. Toast.vue
- **Location**: `/docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Toast.vue`
- **Features**:
  - Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
  - Keyboard support (Escape to dismiss)
  - Multiple types (success, error, warning, info)
  - Progress bar animation
  - Action buttons
  - Stack multiple notifications

### 3. UIProvider.vue
- **Location**: `/docs/.vitepress/theme/components/UIProvider.vue`
- **Purpose**: Renders toasts at the app level

### 4. useUIState.js
- **Location**: `/docs/.vitepress/theme/composables/useUIState.js`
- **Features**:
  - Global state management for modals and toasts
  - Convenience methods (showSuccess, showError, showConfirm, showAlert)
  - Promise-based modal confirmations

## Changes Made

### InlineAbilityEditor.vue
- Replaced `alert()` with `showError()` and `showSuccess()`
- Replaced `confirm()` with `showConfirm()` for save and approve actions
- Added modal confirmation before opening GitHub issues
- Preserved all keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+S, Escape)

### SuggestEdit.vue
- Replaced `window.open()` with modal confirmation
- Shows confirmation before opening GitHub

### Theme Integration
- Updated `index.js` to register components globally
- Wrapped layout with UIProvider for toast rendering
- Added necessary CSS variables to `custom.css`

## Keyboard Shortcuts Preserved
- **Ctrl+S / Cmd+S**: Save changes (now shows modal)
- **Escape**: Close editor or dismiss modal/toast
- **Enter**: Confirm modal action
- **Tab**: Navigate within modal (trapped focus)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   cd eliteredux-darky/codex
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Modal Functionality**:
   - Navigate to any ability page
   - Click "Edit This Ability"
   - Make changes and press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac)
   - Verify modal appears instead of browser confirm
   - Test keyboard: Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel

3. **Test Toast Notifications**:
   - Save changes successfully
   - Verify toast appears at bottom-right
   - Test Escape key to dismiss early
   - Test auto-dismiss after timeout

## Benefits
- ✅ No browser popup blocking issues
- ✅ Consistent UI/UX across browsers
- ✅ Better mobile experience

- ✅ Improved accessibility
- ✅ Modern, themed appearance

## Notes
- The InlineIssueForm component was not implemented as the current solution (modal confirmation before opening GitHub) provides a good user experience
- All keyboard shortcuts work exactly as before
- The components use VitePress theme variables for consistent styling in light/dark modes
