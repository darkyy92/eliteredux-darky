# Eternal Blessing

Eternal Blessing combines the regenerative powers of Celestial Blessing and Regenerator into one divine ability. While under Misty Terrain, the Pok√©mon recovers 1/12 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn, granting exceptional longevity. When switching out, it regains 1/3 of its maximum HP.
