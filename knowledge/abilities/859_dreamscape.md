# Dreamscape - Ability ID 859

## In-Game Description
"Comatose + Dreamcatcher + Deal 20% more damage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Dreamscape combines Comatose and Dreamcatcher, keeping the Pokemon in permanent sleep while being fully functional. Gains complete immunity to all status conditions and deals 20% more damage. The sleep state also enables Dreamcatcher, doubling move power for devastating 140% total damage increase.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Dreamscape is a combination ability that merges three distinct effects:
1. **Comatose component**: Permanent sleep-like state with full functionality and status immunity
2. **Dreamcatcher component**: Double move power when any Pokemon on field is asleep
3. **Additional boost**: Extra 20% damage multiplier on top of other effects

**Total Damage Calculation:**
- Base move power x 2.0 (Dreamcatcher) x 1.2 (additional boost) = **2.4x total multiplier**
- This represents a 140% damage increase over normal move power

### Activation Conditions
- **Always active** - cannot be suppressed or disabled
- Permanent sleep status ensures Dreamcatcher is always triggered
- Status immunity is unsuppressable (survives Mold Breaker, etc.)
- Announces itself on switch-in

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Dreamscape = {
    .onEntry = Comatose.onEntry,  // Announces switch-in, shows sleep status
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            Dreamcatcher.onOffensiveMultiplier(DELEGATE_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER);  // 2.0x
            MUL(1.2);  // Additional 20% boost
        },
    .onStatusImmune = Comatose.onStatusImmune,  // Complete status immunity
    .unsuppressable = TRUE,  // Cannot be disabled
    .removesStatusOnImmunity = TRUE,  // Clears existing status on switch-in
};
```

### Component Analysis

**From Comatose (ID 213):**
- Permanent sleep-like appearance and functionality
- Complete immunity to all status conditions (poison, burn, paralysis, freeze, sleep)
- Unsuppressable - cannot be disabled by any ability or move
- Automatically removes existing status conditions on activation
- Can act normally every turn without "waking up"

**From Dreamcatcher (ID 305):**
- Doubles move power when any battler on field has sleep status
- Since this Pokemon has permanent sleep (via Comatose), Dreamcatcher is always active
- Applies to all damage-dealing moves of any type
- Checks global battlefield state for sleep status

**Additional Enhancement:**
- Extra 1.2x damage multiplier applied after Dreamcatcher
- This stacks multiplicatively: Base x 2.0 x 1.2 = 2.4x total

### Move Interactions
- **All Damage Moves**: Receive the full 2.4x power boost (Dreamcatcher + bonus)
- **Wake-Up Slap**: Deals 4x damage due to sleep status (120 BP to 480 BP with Dreamscape)
- **Dream Eater**: Cannot be used on this Pokemon (no actual sleep, just sleep status)
- **Sleep Talk**: Cannot be used (Comatose prevents selection)
- **Rest**: Has no effect (already immune to status conditions)
- **Snore**: Cannot be used (requires true sleep state)

### Ability Interactions
- **Bad Dreams**: Takes 1/8 HP damage per turn (recognizes sleep status)
- **Sweet Dreams**: Heals 1/8 HP per turn instead of taking damage
- **Mold Breaker/Teravolt/Turboblaze**: Cannot suppress any component of Dreamscape
- **Gastro Acid**: Cannot remove Dreamscape
- **Simple Beam/Worry Seed**: Cannot replace Dreamscape
- **Insomnia/Vital Spirit on allies**: Don't affect Dreamscape since user provides the sleep status

### Strategic Applications

**Offensive Powerhouse:**
- Guaranteed 2.4x damage multiplier makes even weak moves threatening
- 60 BP move becomes 144 BP effective power
- 100 BP move becomes 240 BP effective power
- Combines raw power with complete status immunity

**Versatile Coverage:**
- Boost applies to all move types and categories
- Physical, special, and even some status moves benefit
- Priority moves, multi-hit moves, all receive the boost

**Team Support:**
- Acts as permanent sleep status for teammates with sleep-dependent abilities
- Cannot be status locked or shut down by opponent strategies
- Reliable damage output regardless of opponent's strategy

### Damage Calculations
**Example with 100 BP move:**
- Base: 100 power
- With Dreamscape: 100 x 2.0 x 1.2 = 240 power
- With STAB: 240 x 1.5 = 360 power
- With Life Orb: 360 x 1.3 = 468 power
- With super effective: 468 x 2.0 = 936 effective power

**Example with Wake-Up Slap (60 BP):**
- Base against sleeper: 60 x 2 = 120 power
- With Dreamscape: 120 x 2.0 x 1.2 = 288 power
- Essentially a 480 BP move against sleeping targets
