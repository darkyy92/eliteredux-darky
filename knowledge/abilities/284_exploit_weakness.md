*Character count: 285*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Exploit Weakness is a dual-effect ability that activates when the user attacks a target with any status condition:

### Status Condition Check
The ability uses `HasAnyStatusOrAbility(target)` which returns true if:
- Target has any primary status condition (STATUS1_ANY): sleep, poison, burn, freeze, paralysis
- Target has the Comatose ability (treated as permanently asleep)
- Target is affected by Blood Stain effects

### Damage Boost
When the target meets the status condition, the ability provides a 1.25x damage multiplier to all attacking moves.

### Defensive Stat Targeting
The ability also modifies which defensive stat is used for damage calculation:
- Calculates both Defense and Special Defense stats of the target
- Automatically targets whichever stat is lower
- If Defense < Special Defense, uses Defense for damage calculation
- If Special Defense < Defense, uses Special Defense for damage calculation
- If both stats are equal, uses the normal stat based on move type

### Key Interactions
- Works with both physical and special attacks
- The stat targeting happens regardless of move type (physical moves can target Special Defense if it's lower)
- Both effects only activate when the target has a status condition
- The ability bypasses normal physical/special defensive stat rules when active
- Stacks with other damage multipliers and stat modifications

This makes Exploit Weakness particularly effective against defensive walls that rely on having one strong defensive stat while having a weaker complementary stat.
