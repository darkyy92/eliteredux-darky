# Impaler

Impaler combines the offensive power of Mighty Horn with a dangerous bleeding effect, making horn-based moves significantly more threatening.

## Mechanics

- **Damage Boost**: All horn-based moves deal 30% more damage (inherited from Mighty Horn)
- **Bleed Application**: 30% chance to inflict Bleed status on horn-based moves
- **Type Immunity**: Rock and Ghost types cannot be afflicted with Bleed
- **Status Priority**: Cannot apply Bleed if target already has a primary status condition

## Horn-Based Moves

Examples include:
- Horn Leech
- Smart Strike
- Shocking Jab
- Psyblade
- Hyper Drill
- Fire Glaive
- Psycho Cut

## Bleed Status Effect

Bleed is a primary status condition that:
- Prevents affliction of other primary statuses (Burn, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, Frostbite)
- Rock and Ghost types are immune to Bleed
- Unlike other status conditions, Bleed's specific damage mechanics vary by implementation

## Extended Description

Mighty Horn's 30% damage boost to horn moves combines with a 30% chance to inflict Bleed status. Rock/Ghost types immune. Bleed prevents other status conditions. Stacks multiplicatively with other modifiers.
