# Loose Rocks - Ability ID 405

## In-Game Description
"Deploys Stealth Rocks when hit by contact."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Loose Rocks deploys Stealth Rock entry hazards on the opponent's side when the Pokemon is hit by any contact move. Only triggers once per battle per side. Does not activate if opponent already has Stealth Rock up. Punishes physical attackers and discourages switching.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Loose Rocks is a defensive punishing ability that automatically sets up Stealth Rock hazards on the opponent's side of the field whenever the ability holder is hit by a contact move. This creates a powerful deterrent against physical attacks and punishes opponents for making contact.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move requirement**: The incoming move must make contact with the defender
- **Hit requirement**: The move must successfully hit (not miss, be blocked, etc.)
- **Side status check**: Stealth Rock must not already be present on the opponent's side
- **Battle timing**: Can only activate once per battle per opposing side

### Contact Move Examples
Contact moves that trigger Loose Rocks include:
- **Physical attacks**: Tackle, Body Slam, Earthquake, Close Combat
- **Status moves**: Thunder Wave (if it makes contact)
- **Multi-hit moves**: Each hit can potentially trigger (but only once per side)

### Non-Contact Moves
These moves will NOT trigger Loose Rocks:
- **Projectile moves**: Rock Slide, Flamethrower, Ice Beam
- **Sound moves**: Hyper Voice, Boomburst
- **Pulse moves**: Aura Sphere, Dragon Pulse
- **Long-range moves**: Surf, Earthquake (in some contexts)

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability LooseRocks = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(DidMoveHit())
        CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker))
        CHECK_NOT(gSideStatuses[BATTLE_OPPOSITE(battler)] & SIDE_STATUS_STEALTH_ROCK)

        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_DefenderSetsStealthRock);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Stealth Rock Mechanics
When Loose Rocks triggers, it sets up Stealth Rock on the opponent's side:
- **Entry hazard**: Damages switching Pokemon based on Rock-type effectiveness
- **Damage calculation**: 1/8 max HP x type effectiveness multiplier
- **Type effectiveness**: 
  - 2x damage to Fire, Flying, Bug, Ice types
  - 1x damage to most types
  - 0.5x damage to Steel, Fire types with resist
  - 0.25x damage to Steel types that resist

### Strategic Implications
- **Physical deterrent**: Discourages opponents from using contact moves
- **Switching punishment**: Forces opponents to take hazard damage when switching
- **One-time use**: Can only set Stealth Rock once per battle per side
- **Passive setup**: Requires no turns or move slots to deploy hazards
- **Defensive value**: Provides utility even on defensive Pokemon

### Important Limitations
- **Single activation**: Only works once per battle per opposing side
- **Contact dependency**: Useless against special attackers using ranged moves
- **Hazard clearing**: Opponent can remove with Rapid Spin, Defog, etc.
- **No self-protection**: Doesn't prevent the contact move from dealing damage

### Timing and Interactions
- **Damage first**: The triggering contact move deals its damage first
- **Then hazards**: Stealth Rock is set up after damage calculation
- **Fainting**: Can still trigger even if the ability holder faints from the contact move
- **Substitute**: May not trigger if opponent attacks through Substitute

### Team Synergy
- **Hazard stacking**: Combines well with other hazard setters (Spikes, Toxic Spikes)
- **Spinner blocking**: Pairs with Ghost types that block Rapid Spin
- **Pressure builds**: Works well on teams that force switches
- **Defensive cores**: Excellent on bulky Pokemon that expect physical hits

### Competitive Applications
- **Physical walls**: Great on defensive Pokemon that wall physical attackers
- **Hazard support**: Provides passive hazard setting without moveslot investment
- **Meta dependent**: More valuable in metas with common contact moves
- **Surprise factor**: Opponents may not expect immediate Stealth Rock setup

### Common Users
- **Rock-type Pokemon**: Thematically fits Rock types that might shed stones
- **Defensive Pokemon**: Bulky defensive walls that can survive contact moves
- **Ground types**: Pokemon associated with rocky terrain and debris
- **Physically defensive**: Pokemon built to take physical hits repeatedly

### Counters and Counterplay
- **Special attacks**: Use special moves that don't make contact
- **Hazard removal**: Rapid Spin, Defog, Magic Bounce
- **Long-range moves**: Projectile and pulse moves bypass the ability
- **Status moves**: Many status moves don't make contact
- **One-time limitation**: Once triggered, won't activate again

### Weather and Field Interactions
- **Weather independence**: Not affected by weather conditions
- **Terrain effects**: May interact with terrain but doesn't depend on it
- **Field effects**: Can stack with other field hazards
- **Priority moves**: Contact priority moves can still trigger it

### Related Abilities
- **Iron Barbs**: Also punishes contact but with damage instead of hazards
- **Rough Skin**: Similar contact punishment mechanic
- **Aftermath**: Punishes contact moves that cause fainting
- **Static/Flame Body**: Status-based contact punishment

### Ability Interactions
- **Mold Breaker**: Ignores Loose Rocks and prevents activation
- **Magic Bounce**: Can reflect moves but doesn't affect this ability
- **Neutralizing Gas**: Suppresses the ability while active
- **Trace**: Can copy this ability but effectiveness varies

### Version History
- **Elite Redux original**: This is a custom Elite Redux ability
- **Hazard meta**: Designed for hazard-heavy competitive play
- **Contact punishment**: Part of the suite of contact-punishing abilities
- **Defensive utility**: Provides passive team support for defensive builds
