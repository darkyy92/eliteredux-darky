# Slush Rush - Ability ID 202

## In-Game Description
"This Pokemon's Speed gets a 1.5x boost in hail."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Slush Rush boosts the Pokemon's Speed by 50% during hail weather. Works with all forms of hail including regular hail and primordial hail effects. The speed boost applies immediately when hail is active and disappears when hail ends. Also grants immunity to hail damage.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Slush Rush is an offensive ability that provides a significant Speed boost during hail weather conditions, combined with immunity to hail damage. It's the hail counterpart to abilities like Swift Swim (rain) and Chlorophyll (sun).

### Activation Conditions
- **Weather requirement**: Any form of hail weather must be active
  - Regular hail (from Hail move or Snow Warning)
  - Enhanced hail effects (from various weather abilities)
- **Speed boost**: Multiplies Speed stat by 1.5x (50% increase)
- **Hail immunity**: Takes no damage from hail weather
- **Immediate activation**: Speed boost applies as soon as hail becomes active

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability SlushRush = {
    .onStat =
        +[](ON_STAT) {
            if (statId == STAT_SPEED && IsBattlerWeatherAffected(battler, WEATHER_HAIL_ANY)) *stat *= 1.5;
        },
    .hailImmune = TRUE,
};
```

### Speed Boost Mechanics
- **Base calculation**: Speed = (Base Speed x 1.5) + other modifiers
- **Stacking**: Stacks multiplicatively with other Speed modifiers
- **Nature interaction**: Applied after nature modifiers
- **Item interaction**: Works with Choice Scarf, Iron Ball, etc.
- **Stat stage interaction**: Applied after +/- stat stages

### Important Interactions
- **Weather dependency**: Only active when hail is present
- **Immediate application**: Speed changes take effect immediately when weather changes
- **Battle switching**: Maintains speed boost when switching in during hail
- **Ability suppression**: Doesn't work if ability is suppressed by Mold Breaker effects
- **Hail immunity**: Never takes hail damage regardless of type

### Weather Duration
In Elite Redux, weather effects last 8 turns (not 5 like vanilla), making weather-based abilities significantly more valuable for sustained offensive pressure.

### Strategic Implications
- **Hail team sweeper**: Primary role as fast offensive threat on hail teams
- **Weather abuse**: Can outspeed normally faster threats in hail
- **Setup opportunity**: Can use stat-boosting moves before opponents react
- **Revenge killing**: Excellent for cleaning up weakened teams
- **Weather dependent**: Vulnerable when hail isn't active

### Speed Tier Examples
Assuming base 80 Speed with neutral nature:
- **No hail**: 176 Speed at level 50
- **With Slush Rush**: 264 Speed at level 50
- **With +1 and Slush Rush**: 396 Speed at level 50

### Common Users in Elite Redux
Based on the species analysis, Slush Rush appears on various Ice-type and hail-oriented Pokemon:
- Fast Ice-type sweepers with strong offensive stats
- Pokemon with complementary hail-based abilities as innates
- Mixed attackers who benefit from speed control
- Pokemon paired with Snow Warning teammates

### Competitive Usage Notes
- Essential for hail-based offensive teams
- Requires hail support from Snow Warning or Hail move
- Best on Pokemon with strong offensive stats
- Can be paired with Icy Rock for extended hail duration
- Excellent for breaking through bulky teams with speed advantage

### Team Building Considerations
- **Weather setters**: Needs Snow Warning support or manual Hail setup
- **Coverage moves**: Benefits from diverse move pools to hit different types
- **Setup moves**: Can use Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, etc. more safely
- **Priority moves**: Still valuable for extreme speed control
- **Entry hazards**: Synergizes well with Spikes/Stealth Rock support

### Counters
- **Weather override**: Change weather to Sandstorm, Rain, or Sun
- **Cloud Nine/Air Lock**: Negates weather effects completely  
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas, Gastro Acid
- **Priority moves**: Bypass speed advantage entirely
- **Choice Scarf users**: May still outspeed depending on base stats
- **Trick Room**: Reverses speed advantage into disadvantage

### Synergies
- **Snow Warning**: Essential weather setter for activation
- **Aurora Veil**: Defensive setup move available in hail
- **Blizzard**: 100% accuracy in hail weather
- **Ice-type moves**: Often STAB for hail team members
- **Substitute**: Can set up safely with speed advantage
- **Life Orb/Choice items**: Maximize offensive potential

### Notable Movepool Synergies
Many Slush Rush users gain access to:
- **Blizzard**: Perfect accuracy STAB move in hail
- **Ice Shard**: Priority to handle other priority users
- **Earthquake**: Coverage for Steel and Fire types
- **Rock Slide**: Coverage for Flying types weak to Ice
- **U-turn/Volt Switch**: Momentum with speed advantage

### Version History
- **Generation VII**: Original introduction as signature ability
- **Elite Redux**: Benefits from 8-turn weather duration
- **Innate system**: Can appear as innate ability on certain species
- **Expanded distribution**: Available on more Pokemon than in official games

### Hail Team Core
Slush Rush users form the offensive core of hail teams alongside:
- Snow Warning setters for weather control
- Aurora Veil supporters for defensive setup
- Hail-immune walls for defensive backbone
- Priority users for speed control backup
