# Tipping Point - Ability ID 488

## In-Game Description
"Hit by attacks raises Special Attack by 1, or maximizes on critical hit."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

When this Pokemon is hit by an attack, it raises its Special Attack by 1 stage. If the hit was a critical hit, its Special Attack is immediately maximized to +6 stages instead. This ability triggers after taking damage from offensive moves.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Tipping Point turns defensive vulnerability into offensive opportunity, with critical hits providing explosive setup potential that can instantly transform the Pokemon into a special sweeping threat.

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: When hit by any damaging move
- **Requirements**: Move must hit and deal damage
- **Stat check**: Special Attack must be able to increase
- **Critical hit bonus**: Instantly maximizes Special Attack to +6 stages
- **Normal hit**: Raises Special Attack by 1 stage only

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability TippingPoint = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_SPATK))
        
        if (gIsCriticalHit) {
            SetStatChanger(STAT_SPATK, 12);  // +6 stages (max)
            BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_TargetsStatWasMaxedOut);
        } else {
            SetStatChanger(STAT_SPATK, 1);   // +1 stage
            BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_TargetAbilityStatRaiseOnMoveEnd);
        }
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Critical Hit Mechanics
**Normal critical hits:**
- 1/24 chance for most moves (4.17%)
- High critical ratio moves: 1/8 chance (12.5%)
- Critical hit items: Scope Lens, Razor Claw increase odds
- Focus Energy: Guarantees critical hits

**Critical hit interaction:**
- **Instant setup**: +6 Special Attack in one hit
- **Maximum power**: 4x special attack multiplier immediately
- **Game changer**: Can turn losing positions into sweeping opportunities

### Special Attack Stage Benefits
- **+1 stage**: 1.5x special attack (50% increase)
- **+2 stages**: 2x special attack (100% increase)
- **+3 stages**: 2.5x special attack (150% increase)
- **+4 stages**: 3x special attack (200% increase)
- **+5 stages**: 3.5x special attack (250% increase)
- **+6 stages**: 4x special attack (300% increase)

### Strategic Applications
- **Tank and sweep**: Take hits to build up, then sweep
- **Critical hit fishing**: Use moves with high crit rates
- **Revenge sweeper**: Turn opponent's offense into your setup
- **Special tank**: High special bulk enables safe setup
- **Momentum swing**: Transform defensive situations into offense

### Critical Hit Synergies
**Critical hit boosters:**
- Focus Energy: Guarantees critical hits for max setup

- Super Luck ability: +1 critical hit stage

**High critical ratio moves:**

- Tank physical hits with high Defense
- Accumulate boosts through repeated hits

### Risk-Reward Gameplay
**High-risk scenarios:**
- Staying in against powerful attackers
- Fishing for critical hits from opponents
- Taking unnecessary damage for setup

**High-reward potential:**
- Instant max Special Attack from one crit
- Sweeping potential after accumulating boosts

### Competitive Usage

### Limitations

- **Special Attack only**: Doesn't help physical attacks
- **Critical hit dependency**: Best effects require crits
- **Stat cap**: Cannot exceed +6 Special Attack
- **Fragility**: Taking hits can lead to fainting

### Team Building
