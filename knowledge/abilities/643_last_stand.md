# Last Stand - Ability ID 643

## In-Game Description
Def and SpDef increase as HP drops. Max 1.6x.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Last Stand transforms desperation into defensive prowess. As the Pokemon's HP decreases, both Defense and Special Defense gradually increase proportionally to damage taken, reaching maximum 1.6x multiplier when near fainting. This creates dramatic comeback potential in critical situations.
