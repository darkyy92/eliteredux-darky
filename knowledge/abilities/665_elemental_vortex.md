# Elemental Vortex

Elemental Vortex combines the power of Flash Fire and Water Absorb into one devastating ability. When hit by Fire-type attacks, this Pok√©mon not only negates all damage but gains a 1.5x boost to its Fire-type moves. Meanwhile, Water-type attacks heal 25% HP instead of dealing damage.
