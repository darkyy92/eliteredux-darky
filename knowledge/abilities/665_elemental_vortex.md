Combines Flash Fire and Water Absorb effects.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Immune to Fire and Water-type moves. When hit by a Fire move, boosts the power of those moves my 50% until switching out. When hit by a Water move, restores 25% of the user's max HP.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Elemental Vortex combines the power of Flash Fire and Water Absorb into one devastating ability. When hit by Fire-type attacks, this Pokemon not only negates all damage but gains a 1.5x boost to its Fire-type moves. Meanwhile, Water-type attacks heal 25% HP instead of dealing damage.
