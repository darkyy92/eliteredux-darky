# Gleam Eyes - Ability ID 707

## In-Game Description
"Frisk + Scare."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Gleam Eyes combines Frisk and Scare effects on entry. Checks and disables all opposing Pokemon's held items for two turns while lowering their Special Attack by one stage. This dual intimidation effect disrupts item-dependent strategies and weakens special attackers simultaneously.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Gleam Eyes is a combination ability that triggers two separate effects when the Pokemon enters battle:
1. **Frisk Effect**: Reveals and disables opposing Pokemon's held items
2. **Scare Effect**: Lowers opposing Pokemon's Special Attack by one stage

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Activates automatically when the Pokemon switches into battle
- **Targets**: Affects all opposing Pokemon on the field
- **Priority**: Both effects trigger simultaneously on entry

### Frisk Component
- **Item Detection**: Reveals what items the opposing Pokemon are holding
- **Item Disable**: Disables the effects of opposing Pokemon's held items for 2 turns
- **Scope**: Affects all opposing Pokemon currently on the field
- **Message**: Displays item information to the player

### Scare Component  
- **Stat Reduction**: Lowers opposing Pokemon's Special Attack by one stage
- **Implementation**: Uses the same mechanism as Intimidate but targets Sp. Attack instead of Attack
- **Resistance**: Can be blocked by abilities that prevent stat reduction (Clear Body, White Smoke, etc.)
- **Immunities**: Inner Focus, Own Tempo, Oblivious, Scrappy, and Overwhelm provide immunity

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Gleam Eyes combines UseIntimidateClone (Scare) + Frisk on entry
constexpr Ability GleamEyes = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int { 
        return UseIntimidateClone(ability, battler) | Frisk.onEntry(DELEGATE_ENTRY); 
    },
};
```

### Important Interactions
- **Item Disable Duration**: 2 turns from activation, not affected by switching
- **Stat Stage Limits**: Cannot lower Sp. Attack below -6 stages
- **Multi-Battle**: Effects reset between battles
- **Substitutes**: Stat reduction blocked by Substitute, but Frisk still works
- **Trace/Role Play**: Can copy the ability but won't trigger entry effect until next switch

### Immunities and Resistances
**Scare Effect Blocked By:**
- Clear Body, White Smoke (stat change immunity)
- Inner Focus, Own Tempo, Oblivious (intimidation immunity)  
- Scrappy, Overwhelm (specifically immune to Scare/Intimidate)
- Hyper Cutter (if it protected Sp. Attack, but it doesn't in vanilla)

**Frisk Effect Blocked By:**
- No direct immunities, but some items may be unaffectable
- Still reveals items even if they can't be disabled

### Strategic Applications
- **Special Wall Counter**: Weakens special attackers before they can set up
- **Item Disruption**: Disables key items like Leftovers, Choice items, and berries
- **Lead Pokemon**: Excellent for leading to cripple opposing team setup
- **Pivot Support**: Great for switching in to disrupt opposing strategies
- **Doubles/Triples**: Affects multiple opponents simultaneously

### Team Building Synergies
- **Physical Attackers**: Pairs well with physical attackers who appreciate weakened special walls
- **Hazard Setters**: Works well with entry hazard users to stack pressure
- **Momentum Builders**: Good for maintaining offensive pressure
- **Status Users**: Creates openings for status moves against weakened foes

### Common Counters
- **Stat Immunity**: Clear Body family abilities
- **Intimidation Immunity**: Inner Focus, Own Tempo, Oblivious
- **Rapid Switching**: Switching out removes stat drops (but not item disable)
- **Special Physical Attackers**: Unaffected by Sp. Attack reduction
- **Mold Breaker**: Can ignore ability entirely

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Entry Hazards**: Consider Stealth Rock damage when switching in frequently
- **Prediction Required**: Best used when opponent likely to stay in
- **Late Game**: Less effective when items already consumed
- **Speed Control**: Pair with faster Pokemon to capitalize on weakened foes
