# Soundproof - Ability ID 43

## In-Game Description
"Immune to sound-based moves."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Soundproof grants complete immunity to all sound-based moves, blocking them entirely. Protects against direct damage moves like Boomburst and Hyper Voice, status moves like Sing and Supersonic, and utility moves like Heal Bell and Perish Song. Cannot be broken by Mold Breaker but can be bypassed by moves targeting the user.

*Character count: 289*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**SOUNDPROOF** is a defensive ability that provides complete immunity to all sound-based moves through the onImmune hook.

### Activation Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: When targeted by any move with the FLAG_SOUND flag
- **Check**: Uses IsSoundMove(attacker, move) function which returns true if:
  - Move has FLAG_SOUND flag, OR
  - Move is Normal-type AND attacker has Reverbate ability
- **Immunity Script**: BattleScript_SoundproofProtected displays "{Pokémon}'s {ability} blocks {move}!"
- **Exception**: Does NOT block sound moves that target the user (MOVE_TARGET_USER)

### Sound Move Categories Blocked:
1. **Damaging Sound Moves**:
   - Boomburst (140 BP Normal)
   - Hyper Voice (90 BP Normal) 
   - Disarming Voice (40 BP Fairy)
   - Bug Buzz (90 BP Bug)
   - Snarl (55 BP Dark)

2. **Status Sound Moves**:
   - Sing (Sleep)
   - Supersonic (Confusion)
   - Screech (Defense -2)
   - Metal Sound (Sp. Def -2)
   - Growl (Attack -1)
   - Roar (Forced switch)

3. **Utility Sound Moves**:
   - Heal Bell (Party status cure)
   - Perish Song (3-turn KO countdown)
   - Uproar (3-turn damage + prevents sleep)

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability Soundproof = {
    .onImmune = +[](ON_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(IsSoundMove(attacker, move))
        CHECK_NOT(GetBattlerBattleMoveTargetFlags(move, attacker) & MOVE_TARGET_USER) 
        *immunityScript = BattleScript_SoundproofProtected;
        return TRUE;
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .isSoundproof = TRUE,
};
```

### IsSoundMove Function:
```c
int IsSoundMove(int battler, MoveEnum move) {
    if (gBattleMoves[move].flags & FLAG_SOUND) return TRUE;
    if (gBattleMoves[move].type == TYPE_NORMAL && BattlerHasAbility(battler, ABILITY_REVERBATE, FALSE)) return TRUE;
    return FALSE;
}
```

### Ability Interactions:
- **Mold Breaker/Teravolt/Turboblaze**: Can break through Soundproof immunity (.breakable = TRUE)
- **Reverbate**: Normal moves from Reverbate users become sound moves and are blocked
- **Sound-based abilities**: Other abilities that reference IsSoundMove will recognize Soundproof users as immune
- **Related abilities**: Parroting and Noise Cancel also use Soundproof's onImmune function

### Strategic Applications:
1. **Defensive Wall**: Complete immunity to powerful sound moves like Boomburst
2. **Status Protection**: Blocks sleep from Sing, confusion from Supersonic
3. **Team Support**: Immune to Perish Song strategies
4. **Setup Opportunities**: Forces opponents to switch moves, potentially telegraphing their strategy

### Competitive Counters:
- **Mold Breaker users**: Haxorus, Excadrill, Drilbur line can bypass immunity
- **Non-sound moves**: Physical and special attacks without sound flag
- **Indirect damage**: Entry hazards, weather, status conditions
- **Self-targeting moves**: Moves like Substitute that target the user aren't blocked

### Elite Redux Specific Features:
- **isSoundproof flag**: Used by game engine for internal sound move interactions
- **Multiple sound-immune abilities**: Parroting and Noise Cancel share immunity mechanics
- **Extended sound move pool**: Elite Redux likely includes additional sound moves beyond standard Pokémon games

### Version History:
- Introduced in Generation III as complete sound immunity
- Elite Redux: Enhanced with additional sound move interactions and related abilities
- Maintains consistent immunity mechanics across all sound-based effects

### Notable Users:
Typically found on Pokémon with large ears or sound-dampening biology like Whismur line, though Elite Redux may expand this to additional species through the 4-ability system.
