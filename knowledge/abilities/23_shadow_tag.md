# Shadow Tag - Ability ID 23

## In-Game Description
"Prevents the enemy from escaping. Ghost types are immune."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Shadow Tag traps opposing Pokemon, preventing them from switching out through normal means. Ghost-type Pokemon are completely immune to this trapping effect. Other Shadow Tag users can also switch freely. While trapped, opponents must KO the Shadow Tag user or use special switch moves to escape.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Shadow Tag is a powerful trapping ability that prevents opponents from switching. Implementation in `src/abilities.cc`:

```c
constexpr Ability ShadowTag = {
    .onTrap = +[](ABILITY_ON_TRAP) -> int {
        ON_ABILITY(switchingBattler, FALSE, gAbilities[ability].shadowTag, return FALSE)
        return TRUE;
    },
    .shadowTag = TRUE,
};
```

### Key Features

1. **Trapping Mechanism**:
   - Uses `onTrap` callback triggered when opponent attempts to switch
   - Returns TRUE to prevent the switch
   - Active as long as Shadow Tag user remains on field

2. **Immunity Conditions**:
   - **Ghost-types**: Complete immunity to Shadow Tag's trapping
   - **Other Shadow Tag users**: Can switch freely (checked via `.shadowTag` flag)
   - The `ON_ABILITY` macro checks for these immunities

3. **AI Recognition**:
   - AI Rating: 10 (maximum value, indicating extreme power)
   - AI heavily values this ability for its trapping potential

### Escape Methods
Trapped Pokemon can only escape via:
- **KOing the Shadow Tag user**
- **Switching moves**: U-turn, Volt Switch, Flip Turn, Parting Shot
- **Baton Pass**: Passes stats and switches
- **Teleport**: Switches out with negative priority
- **Emergency Exit/Wimp Out**: Ability-triggered switches
- **Eject Button/Eject Pack**: Item-triggered switches

### Related Abilities

1. **Frenzied Phantom** (ABILITY_FRENZIED_PHANTOM):
   - Combination ability with Parental Bond + Shadow Tag
   - Provides both multi-hit and trapping effects

2. **Similar Trapping Abilities**:
   - **Arena Trap**: Traps only grounded Pokemon
   - **Magnet Pull**: Traps only Steel-types
   - Shadow Tag is the most universal trapper

### Strategic Implications

**Offensive Trapping**:
- Eliminates specific threats by trapping them
- Enables guaranteed KOs on trapped targets
- Pursuit becomes unnecessary with guaranteed trapping

**Support Trapping**:
- Perish Song + Shadow Tag combo
- Setup opportunities against trapped walls
- Encore lock into unfavorable moves

**Team Preview Impact**:
- Opponents must consider Shadow Tag in team selection
- Forces Ghost-type or escape move inclusion
- Creates team building restrictions

### Pokemon with Shadow Tag
In Elite Redux, Shadow Tag appears on:
- Traditional users (Wobbuffet, Wynaut)
- Elite Redux custom forms and Pokemon
- Both as changeable abilities and innate abilities

### Competitive Usage Notes

**Advantages**:
- Removes opponent's switching advantage
- Guarantees favorable matchups
- Eliminates revenge killers
- Controls battle flow

**Limitations**:
- Ghost-types completely immune
- No effect on other Shadow Tag users
- Requires good prediction
- Vulnerable to U-turn momentum

### Counters
- **Ghost-types**: Complete immunity
- **Shed Shell**: Item that allows switching
- **Switch moves**: U-turn, Volt Switch, etc.
- **Shadow Tag**: Mirror matches allow switching
- **Knock Off**: Remove trapping by KOing

### Synergies
- **Perish Song**: Guaranteed KO in 3 turns
- **Pursuit**: Not needed but still effective
- **Setup moves**: Trap walls and set up
- **Encore**: Lock into resisted moves
- **Destiny Bond**: Force lose-lose scenarios

### Doubles/VGC Implications
- Can trap both opponents simultaneously
- Enables partner setup or free attacks
- Countered by Ghost-type leads
- Protect stalling becomes more viable

### Technical Details
- The `.shadowTag = TRUE` flag identifies Shadow Tag-type abilities
- Immunity check prevents Shadow Tag users from trapping each other
- Ghost-type immunity is built into the trapping check

### Version History
Shadow Tag has been consistently powerful but received nerfs over generations:
- Gen 3-5: Trapped everything including Ghost-types
- Gen 6+: Ghost-types became immune
- Elite Redux: Maintains Gen 6+ mechanics with Ghost immunity

The ability remains one of the most powerful in the game due to its ability to control switching, a fundamental battle mechanic.
