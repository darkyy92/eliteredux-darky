# Energy Tap - Ability ID 875

## In-Game Description
"Heals the user for 1/8 of the damage they deal."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Energy Tap heals the Pokemon for 1/8 of all damage dealt to opponents. Works with any damaging move that successfully hits and deals damage. Healing occurs immediately after damage calculation. Does not heal if already at maximum HP. Excellent for sustaining offensive Pokemon in battle.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Energy Tap is a sustain ability that provides healing based on damage output. The ability activates after successfully dealing damage to an opponent, converting a portion of that damage into healing for the user.

### Activation Conditions
- **Damage requirement**: Must deal damage to an opponent with any move
- **HP requirement**: User must not be at maximum HP
- **Healing eligibility**: User must be able to be healed (not affected by Heal Block)
- **Timing**: Activates immediately after damage calculation during the attack sequence

### Healing Calculation
```c
// Energy Tap healing formula
healing_amount = damage_dealt / 8;
if (healing_amount == 0) healing_amount = 1; // Minimum 1 HP heal
```

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability EnergyTap = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK_NOT(BATTLER_MAX_HP(battler))
        CHECK(CanBattlerHeal(battler))

        gBattleMoveDamage = -gHpDealt / 8;
        if (!gBattleMoveDamage) gBattleMoveDamage = -1;
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_HydroCircuitAbsorbEffectActivated);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Move Compatibility
- **Direct damage moves**: All moves that deal direct damage
- **Multi-hit moves**: Heals after each individual hit
- **Critical hits**: Healing scales with the increased damage
- **Super effective hits**: Healing scales with damage multipliers
- **STAB moves**: Healing benefits from STAB damage bonus
- **Status moves**: No healing since they don't deal damage

### Important Interactions
- **Maximum HP**: No healing occurs if already at full health
- **Minimum healing**: Always heals at least 1 HP if damage is dealt
- **Heal Block**: Ability is suppressed while Heal Block is active
- **Substitute**: Does not heal when attacking through Substitute
- **Magic Guard**: Target's Magic Guard doesn't affect Energy Tap healing
- **Rocky Helmet/Rough Skin**: Recoil damage occurs after Energy Tap healing

### Strategic Applications
- **Offensive sustainability**: Allows sweepers to maintain health during long battles
- **Life Orb synergy**: Offsets Life Orb recoil damage partially
- **Multi-hit moves**: Particularly effective with moves like Bullet Seed or Rock Blast
- **High-damage moves**: More effective on Pokemon with powerful single-target moves
- **Mixed attackers**: Benefits from both physical and special damage output

### Competitive Usage
- **Wallbreaker support**: Helps wallbreakers stay healthy during setup
- **Revenge killing**: Allows revenge killers to heal back up after trades
- **Pivot moves**: U-turn/Volt Switch provide healing while maintaining momentum
- **Choice item users**: Provides sustain for Choice Band/Specs users
- **Setup sweepers**: Helps maintain health during setup phases

### Synergies
- **Life Orb**: Partially offsets the recoil damage
- **Choice items**: Provides sustain for locked-in attackers
- **Recoil moves**: Helps offset recoil from moves like Double-Edge
- **Drain moves**: Stacks with drain moves for enhanced healing
- **High base power moves**: Maximizes healing potential

### Counters and Limitations
- **Heal Block**: Completely negates the ability
- **Max HP condition**: No benefit when already at full health
- **Status moves**: Provides no healing from non-damaging moves
- **Low damage output**: Less effective on defensive or utility Pokemon
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker effects disable Energy Tap

### Optimal Users
- High-attack Pokemon that benefit from sustain
- Mixed attackers with diverse move coverage
- Pokemon that use recoil moves or hold Life Orb
- Setup sweepers that need longevity
- Pokemon with multi-hit signature moves

### Comparison to Similar Abilities
- **Drain moves**: Energy Tap works with all damaging moves, not just specific ones
- **Poison Heal**: Provides healing without status condition requirement
- **Regenerator**: Energy Tap requires dealing damage vs. switching out
- **Leftovers**: Provides burst healing vs. gradual passive healing

### Version History
- New ability introduced in Elite Redux
- Part of the expanded ability system for enhanced battle complexity
- Designed to support offensive playstyles with built-in sustainability
