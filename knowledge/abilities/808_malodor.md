# Malodor - Ability ID 808

## In-Game Description
"Suppresses attacker's abilities on contact."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

When hit by a contact move, Malodor suppresses the attacker's ability until they switch out, similar to Gastro Acid. This prevents abilities like Poison Touch, Static, or Flame Body from activating on subsequent turns. The suppression persists even if the Malodor user faints.

*Character count: 294*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger**: Activates when the Malodor user is hit by any contact move
- **Effect**: Applies the STATUS3_GASTRO_ACID status to the attacking Pokemon
- **Duration**: Suppression lasts until the attacker switches out or the battle ends
- **Contact Detection**: Uses the same contact detection as other contact-based abilities

### Activation Conditions
```cpp
CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(attacker))          // Standard on-hit ability check
CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker))       // Move must make contact
CHECK_NOT(gStatuses3[attacker] & STATUS3_GASTRO_ACID)  // Attacker not already suppressed
```

### Technical Implementation
The ability works through the `onDefender` hook in the abilities system:

```cpp
constexpr Ability Malodor = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(attacker))
        CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker))
        CHECK_NOT(gStatuses3[attacker] & STATUS3_GASTRO_ACID)

        gStatuses3[attacker] |= STATUS3_GASTRO_ACID;
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_StackAbilitySuppressedMessage);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Suppression Mechanics
- Uses the same suppression system as Gastro Acid (STATUS3_GASTRO_ACID flag)
- Suppressed abilities are checked via `IsSuppressed()` function in battle_util.c
- Does not affect abilities with the "unsuppressable" flag
- Blocked by Ability Shield (if the attacker has one)

### Contact Move Detection
Contact moves are determined by:
1. Move has the `contact` flag in battle data
2. Special case: Shell Side Arm when physical
3. Bypassed by Long Reach ability
4. Bypassed by Protective Pads item
5. Bypassed by Punching Glove for punch moves

### Affected Moves (Examples)
**Contact moves that trigger Malodor:**
- Physical attacks: Tackle, Body Slam, Earthquake, etc.
- Special contact moves: Petal Dance, Grass Knot
- Multi-hit moves: Fury Attack, Pin Missile
- Priority moves: Quick Attack, Mach Punch

**Non-contact moves that don't trigger:**
- Projectile moves: Thunderbolt, Flamethrower
- Sound moves: Boomburst, Hyper Voice
- Long-range moves: Rock Slide, Surf

### Strategic Implications
**Offensive Use:**
- Excellent counter to contact-based setup sweepers
- Shuts down abilities like Guts, Flame Orb combos via contact
- Forces switches on Pokemon relying on their abilities

**Defensive Use:**
- Protects team from status-inducing contact abilities
- Disrupts opposing strategies dependent on specific abilities
- Creates long-term advantage through ability suppression

### Common Users
- **Mega Garbodor**: Primary user in Elite Redux, fits thematically with toxic/foul odor concept
- Type combination: Poison/Steel with defensive stats

### Competitive Applications
**Team Roles:**
- Physical wall that punishes contact attackers
- Anti-setup utility Pokemon
- Switch-in for contact-based threats

**Synergies:**
- Works well with entry hazards to punish forced switches
- Combines with status moves to cripple suppressed opponents
- Effective on bulky Pokemon that can tank multiple contact hits

### Counters and Limitations
**Counters:**
- Special attackers using non-contact moves
- Pokemon with Long Reach ability
- Protective Pads item users
- Magic Bounce (reflects suppression effects)

**Limitations:**
- Only triggers on contact moves hitting the user
- Cannot suppress already suppressed Pokemon
- No effect on Pokemon with Ability Shield
- Requires taking damage to activate

**Unsuppressable Abilities:**
- Core abilities that cannot be suppressed include certain forme-maintaining abilities
- Battle Bond, Power Construct, and similar form-based abilities

### Battle Message
When activated, displays: "[Pokemon]'s ability was suppressed!"

### Version History
- Introduced in Elite Redux as ID 808
- Part of the expanded ability roster for enhanced strategic depth
- Themed around the concept of foul odors disrupting opponents' natural abilities
