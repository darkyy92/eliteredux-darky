# White Noise

**ID:** 654
**Description:** Static + Rest in Peace.

## Extended Description

White Noise combines Static's paralysis-inducing contact effects with Peaceful Rest's restorative healing properties. When opponents make physical contact, this ability has a 30% chance to paralyze the attacker. Additionally, during fog weather, it heals 1/8 max HP at the end of each turn.
