# Cloud Nine - Ability ID 13

## In-Game Description
"Clears weather and prevents its effects."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Cloud Nine clears all weather upon switch-in and completely nullifies weather effects while the user remains on field. Weather can still be set but provides no benefits - no damage boosts, speed changes, or other effects. Works on all weather including primal conditions. Essential for shutting down weather teams.

*Character count: 297*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Cloud Nine operates through two distinct mechanisms:

1. **On-Entry Weather Removal**: When a Pokémon with Cloud Nine enters battle, it executes `BattleScript_AnnounceAirLockCloudNine` which:
   - Immediately removes any active weather condition
   - Displays appropriate messages about weather being cleared
   - Works on both regular and primal weather conditions

2. **Passive Weather Nullification**: While on field, Cloud Nine prevents ALL weather effects via the `WEATHER_HAS_EFFECT` macro:
   ```c
   #define WEATHER_HAS_EFFECT (!IsAbilityOnField(ABILITY_CLOUD_NINE))
   ```

### Complete List of Blocked Effects
- **Damage Effects**: No Sandstorm/Hail chip damage
- **Type Modifications**: 
  - Water moves don't get 50% boost in rain
  - Fire moves don't get 50% reduction in rain
  - Fire moves don't get 50% boost in sun
  - Water moves don't get 50% reduction in sun
- **Stat Modifications**: Rock-types don't get 50% SpDef boost in sand
- **Ability Activations**: 
  - Swift Swim/Chlorophyll/Sand Rush don't double Speed
  - Rain Dish/Dry Skin/Ice Body don't activate
  - Solar Power/Harvest don't trigger
- **Move Changes**:
  - Solar Beam/Solar Blade still require charging
  - Thunder/Hurricane don't get accuracy boosts
  - Weather Ball remains Normal-type
  - Morning Sun/Moonlight/Synthesis heal standard amounts

### Technical Implementation
- Located in `src/abilities.cc`
- Uses shared code with Air Lock ability
- AI evaluates with `AI_SCORE_REMOVE_WEATHER` rating
- The weather itself remains set but is completely ineffective

### Interactions with Other Abilities
- **Air Lock**: Functions identically to Cloud Nine
- **Clueless**: Prevents weather, terrain, AND room effects
- **Weather-setting abilities**: Can still activate but provide no benefit
- **Primal weather**: Cloud Nine clears even primal weather on entry

### Strategic Implications
- **Anti-Weather Tech**: Hard counter to weather-based strategies
- **Defensive Utility**: Protects team from chip damage and weather boosts
- **Speed Control**: Negates Swift Swim/Chlorophyll/Sand Rush threats
- **Offensive Disruption**: Removes opponent's weather-based damage boosts
- **Switch Timing**: Crucial to time switches for maximum weather denial

### Common Users
Pokémon with access to Cloud Nine in Elite Redux include various defensive and support-oriented species that benefit from weather control.

### Competitive Usage Notes
- Excellent on balanced teams that don't rely on weather
- Pairs well with setup sweepers who appreciate neutral conditions
- Can enable Fire-types to check Water-types in would-be rain
- Allows Ice-types to survive in would-be sun
- Creates "weather wars" where timing becomes critical

### Counters
- Weather setters can reset after Cloud Nine user switches
- Abilities that don't rely on weather (Intimidate, Regenerator, etc.)
- Direct offense to force Cloud Nine user out
- U-turn/Volt Switch to maintain momentum while resetting weather

### Synergies
- Stealth Rock setters (capitalize on forced switches)
- Pokémon weak to weather chip damage
- Mixed attackers who want consistent damage calculations
- Stall teams that prefer neutral conditions

### Version History
Elite Redux maintains the Gen 5+ implementation where Cloud Nine blocks weather effects rather than just preventing weather from being set (as in Gen 3-4).
