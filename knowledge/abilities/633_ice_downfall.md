# Ice Downfall

**Basic Description:** Counters contact with 60BP Icicle Crash.

**Extended Description:** When hit by a contact move, the Pokemon retaliates with Icicle Crash at 60 base power. This defensive ability punishes physical attackers with an automatic Ice-type counter-attack that can flinch the opponent. The retaliation doesn't consume PP, making it an effective deterrent.

**Mechanics:**
- Triggers only when hit by moves that make contact
- Uses Icicle Crash with 60 base power (reduced from its normal 85)
- The counter-attack is Ice-type and physical
- Can potentially flinch the original attacker (20% chance)
- Does not trigger if the user faints from the contact move

**Strategic Applications:**
- Excellent deterrent against physical attackers
- Provides immediate punishment for contact moves
- Can disrupt opponent's strategies with unexpected retaliation
- Particularly effective against Fighting, Flying, and Ground-type attackers
- Works well on bulky Ice-types that can survive contact moves

**Similar Abilities:**
- Rough Skin (damages on contact)
- Static (paralyzes on contact)
- Flame Body (burns on contact)
- Iron Barbs (damages on contact)
