# Unicorn - Ability ID 647

## In-Game Description
Combines the effects of Mighty Horn and Pixilate abilities.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

This mystical ability grants horn-based moves a 30% power boost while converting all Normal-type moves to Fairy-type. The converted moves gain additional power and benefit from STAB if the user is Fairy-type, making unicorn Pokemon fearsome with both physical horn attacks and magical fairy power.
