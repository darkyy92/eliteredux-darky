# Unicorn

**Effect**: Combines the effects of Mighty Horn and Pixilate abilities.

**Extended Description**: This mystical ability grants horn-based moves a 30% power boost while converting all Normal-type moves to Fairy-type. The converted moves gain additional power and benefit from STAB if the user is Fairy-type, making unicorn Pokemon fearsome with both physical horn attacks and magical fairy power.
