# Shields Down - Ability ID 197

## In-Game Description
"At 1/2 of max HP or below, transforms into Core form."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Shields Down transforms Minior from Meteor Form to Core Form when HP drops to 50% or below. In Meteor Form, grants immunity to all status conditions. When using Shell Smash, immediately transforms to Core Form regardless of current HP. Cannot revert back to Meteor Form once transformed during battle.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Shields Down is Minior's signature ability that manages its unique dual-form system:

1. **Form Transformation**: Automatically transforms from Meteor Form to Core Form when HP falls to 50% or below
2. **Status Immunity**: While in Meteor Form, grants complete immunity to all status conditions (poison, burn, paralysis, sleep, freeze)
3. **Shell Smash Trigger**: Using Shell Smash immediately forces transformation to Core Form regardless of current HP
4. **One-Way Transformation**: Cannot revert back to Meteor Form during battle once transformed

### Technical Implementation
The ability uses the HP transformation system with these parameters:
```c
// HP fraction of 2 means transforms at 1/2 (50%) HP
{ABILITY_SHIELDS_DOWN, SPECIES_MINIOR, SPECIES_MINIOR_CORE_RED, 2}
```

Key code components:
- **Status Immunity**: Checks if battler is in Meteor Form and blocks all status conditions
- **HP-Based Check**: Monitors HP every turn and triggers transformation at 50% HP threshold
- **Shell Smash Override**: Uses `EFFECT_SHELL_SMASH` detection to force immediate transformation
- **Ability State**: Uses ability state tracking to prevent reverting to Meteor Form

### Affected Pokemon
- **Minior** (all color variants):
  - Meteor Orange to Core Orange
  - Meteor Yellow to Core Yellow
  - Meteor Green to Core Green
  - Meteor Blue to Core Blue
  - Meteor Indigo to Core Indigo
  - Meteor Violet to Core Violet
  - Red (default) to Core Red

### Strategic Implications
**Meteor Form Advantages:**
- Complete status immunity
- Higher defensive stats
- Protection from indirect damage sources

**Core Form Advantages:**
- Higher Speed and offensive stats
- Access to full moveset effectiveness
- Better sweeping potential

**Shell Smash Strategy:**
- Can voluntarily trigger transformation with Shell Smash
- Combines stat boosts with form change
- Allows strategic timing of transformation

### Interactions with Other Mechanics
- **Unsuppressable**: Cannot be suppressed by abilities like Gastro Acid
- **Transform Protection**: Cannot be copied by Transform or Imposter
- **Weather Independence**: Unlike Forecast, not affected by weather changes
- **Entry/End Turn**: Shares transformation checking with Forecast ability

### Counters
- **Indirect Damage**: Use entry hazards or weather to chip HP in Meteor Form
- **Multi-Hit Moves**: Can break through and trigger transformation mid-attack
- **Status After Transform**: Can inflict status once in Core Form
- **Priority Moves**: Effective against fast Core Form

### Version History
- Elite Redux implementation includes all Minior color variants
- Maintains official Pokemon mechanics with enhanced form variety
- Integrated with the game's HP transformation system
