# Biofilm - Ability ID 836

## In-Game Description
Biofilm provides a significant defensive boost to the user's Special Defense when Toxic Terrain is active on the battlefield.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Secrets a protective toxic film when exposed to Toxic Terrain, reinforcing cellular membranes against energy-based attacks. This biofilm coating increases Special Defense by 50% while the user remains in contact with the poisonous ground, making them remarkably resilient to special moves.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Detailed Mechanics

### Special Defense Boost
- **Boost Amount**: 50% increase (1.5x multiplier)
- **Condition**: Must be on Toxic Terrain
- **Affected by Terrain**: User must be grounded (not Flying-type, Levitating, or holding Air Balloon)
- **Stat Stage**: This is a direct stat multiplier, not a stat stage change
- **Stacks**: The multiplier applies to the final Special Defense value after all other modifiers

### Terrain Interaction
- Only activates when the battlefield has Toxic Terrain active
- If Toxic Terrain ends or is replaced by another terrain, the boost immediately disappears
- The ability checks terrain affection status, so Flying-types and Levitate users won't benefit

### Battle Applications
- Synergizes perfectly with Toxic Surge ability users who set Toxic Terrain on entry
- Makes the user significantly more resilient to special attacks in poison-themed teams
- No effect in battles without Toxic Terrain, making it situational but powerful

## Pokemon with Biofilm
- **Vileplume**: Has Biofilm as one of its innate abilities, complementing its Poison typing
