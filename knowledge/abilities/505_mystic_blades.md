## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**MYSTIC BLADES** is a move conversion ability that transforms physical slashing and cutting moves into special attacks while providing significant damage amplification.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Damage Multiplier**: 1.3x (30% boost) to all keen edge moves
- **Move Conversion**: Changes physical keen edge moves to special split
- **Stat Usage**: Converted moves use Special Attack and target Special Defense
- **Move Count**: Affects over 50 moves with the FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST flag

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability MysticBlades = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = KeenEdge.onOffensiveMultiplier,  // 1.3x damage boost
    .onSwapSplit = +[](ON_SWAP_SPLIT) -> int {
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].split == SPLIT_PHYSICAL)
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].flags & FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST);
        return TRUE;  // Converts physical keen edge moves to special
    },
};
```

- Mystic Blades Psycho Cut: 91 BP special (uses 135 Special Attack)
- Over 4x damage increase from stat difference and multiplier

### Competitive Usage:

### Common Users:
While any Pokemon with access to Mystic Blades benefits, ideal users have:
- High Special Attack
- Access to multiple slashing moves
- Need for physical coverage as special attackers

### Example Set:
**Theoretical Special Attacker @ Life Orb**
- Leaf Blade (Grass coverage)
- Night Slash (Dark coverage)
- Psycho Cut (Psychic STAB)
- Air Slash (Flying coverage)

### Counters:
- High Special Defense walls
- Pokemon resistant to common slash types
- Priority users before conversion attacks land
- Fort Knox negates the damage boost

### Related Abilities:

- **Sharpness**: Different boost amount, affects similar moves
