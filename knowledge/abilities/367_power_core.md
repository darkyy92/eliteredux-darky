# Power Core - Ability ID 367

## In-Game Description
"The Pokémon uses +20% of its Defense or SpDef during moves."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Adds 20% of Defense to physical attacks and 20% of Special Defense to special attacks when calculating damage. This defensive stat bonus is applied after all other modifiers, effectively making attacks stronger based on your defensive bulk. Works with all offensive moves.

*Character count: 290*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**POWER CORE** is a unique offensive ability that converts defensive stats into offensive power by adding a percentage of defensive stats to the attacker's offensive stats during damage calculation.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Physical Moves**: Adds 20% of the user's Defense stat to the Attack calculation
- **Special Moves**: Adds 20% of the user's Special Defense stat to the Special Attack calculation
- **Stat Selection**: Automatically determines which defensive stat to use based on move type (physical vs special)
- **Application**: The bonus is added to the `secondaryAtkStatToUse` array during stat calculation

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability PowerCore = {
    .onChooseOffensiveStat = +[](ON_CHOOSE_OFFENSIVE_STAT) { 
        secondaryAtkStatToUse[IS_MOVE_PHYSICAL(move) ? STAT_DEF : STAT_SPDEF] += 20; 
    },
};
```

**Location**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 3822-3824)

### Calculation Breakdown:
1. **Move Type Check**: `IS_MOVE_PHYSICAL(move)` determines if the move is physical or special
2. **Stat Selection**: Physical moves use `STAT_DEF`, special moves use `STAT_SPDEF`
3. **Bonus Application**: Adds 20 points to the secondary attack stat array
4. **Final Calculation**: The game combines the user's base offensive stat with 20% of the corresponding defensive stat

### Related Abilities:
Power Core shares its implementation pattern with several other abilities:
- **Slipstream** (ID 356): Adds 20% of Speed to offensive calculations
- **Best Offense** (ID 421): Adds 20% of Special Defense to offensive calculations
- **Magus Blades** (ID 423): Adds 20% of Special Defense to offensive calculations

### Strategic Implications:
1. **Bulk + Power Synergy**: Rewards investment in defensive stats with offensive returns
2. **Stat Distribution**: Encourages mixed defensive/offensive builds rather than pure glass cannon
3. **Defensive Walls**: Transforms defensive Pokémon into surprisingly potent threats
4. **Item Synergy**: Defensive items like Leftovers or Assault Vest provide indirect offensive benefits

### Example Damage Scenarios:
**Scenario 1**: A Pokémon with 100 Attack and 150 Defense using a physical move
- **Normal**: Uses 100 Attack for damage calculation
- **With Power Core**: Uses 100 Attack + (150 × 0.20) = 130 effective Attack

**Scenario 2**: Same Pokémon using a special move with 80 Special Attack and 120 Special Defense
- **Normal**: Uses 80 Special Attack for damage calculation
- **With Power Core**: Uses 80 Special Attack + (120 × 0.20) = 104 effective Special Attack

### Pokémon Distribution:
Power Core appears on numerous powerful Pokémon in Elite Redux:

**Legendary/Mythical Users (Innate):**
- **Dialga** (both forms) - Primal Armor/Impenetrable/Power Core
- **Palkia** (both forms) - Prism Scales or Sea Guardian/Overwhelm or Sea Guardian/Power Core
- **Arceus** (all forms) - Multitype/Pressure/Power Core and Levitate
- **Zygarde** (all forms) - Power Construct/Primal Armor/Earthbound/Power Core
- **Necrozma forms** - Vengeance or Power Fists/various/Power Core
- **Magearna** (both forms) - Clear Body/Mirror Armor/Soul Heart/Power Core

**Defensive Specialists:**
- **Shuckle line** - Simple/Power Core/Loose Rocks with Shell Armor/Natural Cure/Impenetrable
- **Tyranitar** - Sand Stream/Juggernaut/Battle Armor/Power Core
- **Registeel variants** - Fortitude/various/Power Core/Impenetrable/Self Sufficient

**Mixed Attackers:**
- **Machamp Redux** - Dragonslayer/Brawling Wyvern/Stamina/Power Core
- **Melmetal** - Clear Body/Mirror Armor/Soul Heart/Power Core
- **Various Rock/Steel types** - Often paired with Impenetrable and other defensive abilities

### Competitive Analysis:
**Strengths:**
- Rewards defensive investment with offensive returns
- Works with all offensive moves, no restrictions
- Scales with stat boosts and defensive items
- Excellent on bulky offensive Pokémon

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires significant defensive stats to be impactful
- No benefit to status moves or non-damaging moves
- Competes with other offensive abilities for value
- Diminishing returns on glass cannon builds

**Ideal Users:**
- Bulky attackers with balanced offensive/defensive stats
- Pokémon with naturally high defensive stats
- Mixed attackers that can leverage both bonuses
- Defensive Pokémon that want some offensive presence

### Competitive Tier Justification:
**Medium Tier** - Power Core provides meaningful but not overwhelming offensive benefits. It's most effective on Pokémon that already invest in defensive stats, making it a solid choice for bulky offensive builds but not game-changing enough for top tier.

**Comparison to Similar Abilities:**
- **Huge Power/Pure Power**: Direct 2x multiplier vs situational 20% boost
- **Adaptability**: Guaranteed 2x STAB vs conditional 20% boost
- **Life Orb effect**: 30% boost with recoil vs 20% boost with no downside

### Team Building Considerations:
1. **Stat Investment**: Prioritize defensive stats alongside offensive ones
2. **Item Choices**: Defensive items provide indirect offensive benefits
3. **Role Compression**: Allows defensive Pokémon to threaten offensively
4. **Movepool**: Benefits from diverse offensive movepools to utilize both bonuses

### Counters and Answers:
- **Stat Reduction**: Abilities like Intimidate reduce the base stat before Power Core applies
- **Defensive Answers**: Power Core doesn't overcome type disadvantages or resistances
- **Status Moves**: Burns, paralysis, and other status conditions still affect performance
- **Mold Breaker effects**: Cannot be bypassed as this is a stat calculation ability

### Version History:
- **Elite Redux**: Original implementation as ability #367
- **Design Intent**: Create synergy between defensive and offensive investment
- **Balance Philosophy**: Reward defensive building without making defensive Pokémon overpowered

### Usage Tips:
1. **Maximize defensive stats** through EVs, nature, and items
2. **Use mixed movesets** to leverage both Defense and Special Defense bonuses
3. **Pair with defensive items** for sustained offensive pressure
4. **Consider entry hazard support** to maximize offensive opportunities
5. **Use on Pokémon with naturally high defensive stats** for maximum impact

### Notable Interactions:
- **Assault Vest**: Boosts Special Defense, indirectly boosting special moves
- **Eviolite**: Provides massive defensive boosts, greatly enhancing Power Core's effectiveness
- **Defensive natures**: Become offensive investments with Power Core
- **Stat-boosting moves**: Defensive boosts (Iron Defense, Cosmic Power) increase offensive power
