# Entrance - Ability ID 611

## In-Game Description
"When this Pokemon confuses an opponent, it simultaneously infatuates all eligible opposing Pokemon."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When this Pokemon confuses an opponent, it simultaneously infatuates all eligible opposing Pokemon of the opposite gender. The infatuation effect only applies to targets that aren't already infatuated or protected by immunity. This creates devastating dual status combinations in battle.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

**Source Code Location:** `/src/abilities.cc` line 6436-6441

**Core Mechanism:**
```cpp
constexpr Ability Entrance = {
    .onReactive = +[](ON_REACTIVE) -> int { 
        return PoisonPuppeteerClone(ability, battler, CanInfatuate, BattleScript_Entrance); 
    },
    .onBattlerFaints = PoisonPuppeteer.onBattlerFaints,
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_OTHER,
    .setStateOnEffect = MOVE_EFFECT_CONFUSION,
};
```

**Trigger Condition:** `MOVE_EFFECT_CONFUSION` - Activates when the user inflicts confusion on any opponent.

**Effect:** Uses `BattleScript_Entrance` which sets `MOVE_EFFECT_ATTRACT` (infatuation) via `PoisonPuppeteerClone`.

### Detailed Mechanics

### Activation Process
1. User inflicts confusion on opponent(s)
2. `PoisonPuppeteerClone` function executes
3. For each confused opponent, checks `CanInfatuate(battler, target)`
4. If infatuation is possible, applies attract effect via `BattleScript_Entrance`

### Target Validation (CanInfatuate function)
- Target must not already be infatuated
- Target must be alive
- Different battlers (cannot infatuate self)
- Gender compatibility:
  - Both Pokemon must have genders (not genderless)
  - Must be opposite genders
- Bypassed by Mycelium Might or Pure Love abilities
- Blocked by status protection abilities

### State Management
- Inherits faint tracking from PoisonPuppeteer
- Removes state flags when tracked opponents faint
- State persists across multiple confusion applications

### Strategic Applications

**Optimal Usage:**
- Multi-target confusion moves (e.g., Supersonic in doubles)
- Status-spreading team compositions
- Control-oriented battle strategies

**Synergistic Moves:**
- Confuse Ray, Supersonic, Sweet Kiss
- Multi-hit confusion moves
- Priority confusion moves

**Competitive Considerations:**
- Powerful in doubles/multi-battles
- Countered by same-gender teams
- Effectiveness reduced by Mental Herb/status immunity
