# Sweeping Edge Plus - Ability ID 590

## In-Game Description
"Sweeping Edge + Keen Edge."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Sweeping Edge Plus combines the power of both Keen Edge and Sweeping Edge abilities. All Keen Edge moves gain 30% damage boost, perfect accuracy, and hit both opposing Pokemon in double battles. This transforms single-target slicing moves into devastating multi-target blade attacks.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Sweeping Edge Plus (also known as "Blademaster") is an upgraded combination ability that merges the effects of two powerful abilities: Keen Edge and Sweeping Edge. This creates a supremely powerful offensive ability for Pokemon that rely on slicing attacks.

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
// From src/abilities.cc - Sweeping Edge Plus definition
constexpr Ability SweepingEdgePlus = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = KeenEdge.onOffensiveMultiplier,
    .onAccuracy = SweepingEdge.onAccuracy,
};
```

### Ability Effects
Sweeping Edge Plus provides three distinct enhancements to Keen Edge moves:

1. **30% Damage Boost**: All Keen Edge moves deal 1.3x damage (inherited from Keen Edge ability)
2. **Perfect Accuracy**: All Keen Edge moves become unable to miss (inherited from Sweeping Edge ability)
3. **Multi-Target**: In double battles, Keen Edge moves hit both opposing Pokemon instead of just one (inherited from Sweeping Edge ability)

### Activation Conditions
- **Move requirement**: The move must have the `FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST` flag
- **Always active**: All three effects apply automatically when using eligible moves
- **Battle format**: Multi-target effect only applies in double battles where there are two opponents

### Keen Edge Move Categories
Keen Edge moves are slicing, cutting, or chopping attacks that have been designated with the `FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST` flag. All moves affected by the base Keen Edge and Sweeping Edge abilities are enhanced by Sweeping Edge Plus:

**Physical Slicing Moves:**
- Slash - High critical hit ratio, now hits both foes with 30% boost
- Leaf Blade - Grass-type blade attack with perfect accuracy and damage boost
- Dragon Claw - Dragon-type slashing move, enhanced for multi-target
- Night Slash - Dark-type blade attack with guaranteed hits
- Psycho Cut - Psychic-type cutting move with multi-target capability
- Cross Chop - Fighting-type crossing attack with perfect accuracy
- Karate Chop - Fighting-type chopping attack, boosted and multi-hit

**Special Slicing Moves:**
- Air Slash - 30% flinch chance + 30% damage boost + perfect accuracy + multi-target

### Battle Interactions
- **Double battles**: Keen Edge moves hit both opposing Pokemon with full damage and accuracy
- **Single battles**: Provides 30% damage boost and perfect accuracy
- **Accuracy bypass**: Completely ignores accuracy reductions, evasion boosts, and weather effects
- **Critical hits**: Each target is calculated independently for critical hits
- **Contact moves**: Contact effects can trigger from both targets independently
- **Damage calculation**: Each target receives the full 30% damage boost

### Strategic Applications
- **Ultimate offensive ability**: Combines three powerful enhancements into one ability slot
- **Double battle dominance**: Transforms single-target moves into devastating spread attacks
- **Accuracy independence**: Never misses regardless of battlefield conditions
- **Damage maximization**: Effectively increases damage output by 30% while doubling targets
- **Moveset flexibility**: Encourages diverse Keen Edge movesets for maximum coverage

### Comparison to Component Abilities
**vs. Keen Edge (ID 271):**
- Sweeping Edge Plus adds perfect accuracy and multi-target effects
- Same 30% damage multiplier for eligible moves

**vs. Sweeping Edge (ID 421):**
- Sweeping Edge Plus adds the 30% damage boost
- Same perfect accuracy and multi-target effects

**Combined Power:**
- Takes the best aspects of both parent abilities
- No drawbacks or limitations beyond those of the individual components
- Represents the pinnacle of slicing-based offensive abilities

### Example Damage Calculations
**Leaf Blade (90 BP) in Double Battle:**
- Without ability: 90 BP to one target
- With Sweeping Edge Plus: 117 BP effective (90 x 1.3) to BOTH targets

**Air Slash (75 BP Special) in Double Battle:**
- Without ability: 75 BP to one target, can miss
- With Sweeping Edge Plus: 97.5 BP effective (75 x 1.3) to BOTH targets, always hits

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Elite tier ability**: One of the most powerful offensive abilities in Elite Redux
- **VGC dominance**: Extremely powerful in double battle formats
- **Immediate impact**: No setup required, effects apply instantly
- **Type coverage**: Works across multiple move types with slicing motions
- **Crit synergy**: Many Keen Edge moves have high critical hit ratios

### Common Users
This ability is typically found on:
- Elite-tier Pokemon with access to multiple Keen Edge moves
- Physical attackers with diverse slicing movesets
- Pokemon designed for double battle formats
- Late-game or legendary Pokemon with enhanced ability sets

### Important Interactions
- **Priority moves**: Keen Edge priority moves maintain their speed tier
- **Multi-hit moves**: Each hit gains perfect accuracy and damage boost
- **Protection moves**: Each target's Protect/Detect is calculated separately
- **Abilities that trigger on hit**: Abilities like Static or Rough Skin can trigger from both targets
- **Entry hazards**: Spikes/Stealth Rock damage both targets after spread moves

### Counters
- **Wide Guard**: Blocks the spread effect of converted moves in double battles
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas, or similar abilities
- **Single battles**: Reduces effectiveness by removing multi-target component
- **Non-Keen Edge moves**: Ability doesn't affect moves without the appropriate flag
- **Type immunity**: Ghost types immune to Normal/Fighting Keen Edge moves
- **Extremely high defensive stats**: May still wall even boosted attacks

### Synergies
- **High critical hit ratio**: Many Keen Edge moves have increased crit rates
- **STAB bonus**: Same-type attack bonus stacks multiplicatively
- **Choice items**: Choice Band/Specs further amplify already-boosted moves
- **Weather effects**: Sun/Rain can boost Fire/Water-type slicing moves
- **Setup moves**: Works excellently after Swords Dance or similar attack boosts

### Version History
- Elite Redux exclusive ability (ID 590)
- Represents the ultimate evolution of slicing-based abilities
- Combines two pre-existing abilities into one superior version
- Part of the "Plus" series of upgraded combination abilities

### Move Compatibility
Only moves with the `FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST` flag are affected. This includes most slicing, cutting, and chopping attacks, but not all blade-themed moves necessarily qualify. Check individual move descriptions for "Keen Edge boost" to confirm compatibility.

### Design Philosophy
Sweeping Edge Plus represents the concept of a master swordsman or blade specialist who has perfected their craft. The ability embodies the idea of surgical precision (perfect accuracy), enhanced technique (damage boost), and sweeping strikes (multi-target capability) that define a true blademaster in combat.
