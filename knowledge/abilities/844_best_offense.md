This ability combines two powerful offensive mechanics. First, it applies the Keen Edge effect, boosting damage by 30% on all slashing, cutting, and blade-based moves.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Dual Benefit System
This ability combines two powerful offensive mechanics. First, it applies the Keen Edge effect, boosting damage by 30% on all slashing, cutting, and blade-based moves. Second, during damage calculation, it adds 20% of the user's Special Defense stat to supplement the primary attacking stat, providing extra damage based on defensive investment.

### Mystic Conversion
The Mystic Blades component transforms all Keen Edge-boosted physical moves into special attacks while maintaining their damage boost. This allows physical attackers to bypass high Defense stats by targeting Special Defense instead, creating unique strategic options for traditionally physical Pokemon with blade-based movesets.
