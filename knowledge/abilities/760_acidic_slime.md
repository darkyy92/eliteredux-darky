# Acidic Slime - Ability ID 760

## In-Game Description
"Corrosion + Poison STAB."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Acidic Slime grants Water-type moves STAB bonus (1.5x damage) regardless of user's actual type and allows Poison moves to hit Steel types for 2x damage instead of immunity. Can poison any type including Steel and Poison. Effectively combines offensive typing flexibility with status utility.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Acidic Slime is a hybrid ability that combines the effects of Corrosion with additional Water-type STAB functionality.

### Core Mechanics

**Water-type STAB:**
- All Water-type moves receive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)
- Damage multiplier: 1.5x for Water moves
- Applied regardless of the user's actual typing

**Corrosion Effects:**
- Poison-type moves hit Steel-type Pokemon for 2x damage instead of immunity
- Can inflict poison status on any type, including Steel and Poison types
- Bypasses normal type-based status immunities for poison

### Technical Implementation

```cpp
constexpr Ability AcidicSlime = {
    .onStab = +[](ON_STAB) -> int { return moveType == TYPE_WATER; },
    .onTypeEffectiveness = Corrosion.onTypeEffectiveness,
    .onCanStatusType = Corrosion.onCanStatusType,
};
```

The implementation references the existing Corrosion ability for type effectiveness and status mechanics while adding Water STAB.

### Type Effectiveness Changes

**Against Steel Types:**
- Poison moves: 0x to 2x damage
- All other type interactions remain unchanged

### Status Infliction

**Poison Status:**
- Can poison Steel types (normally immune)
- Can poison Poison types (normally immune)
- Works with moves like Toxic, Poison Gas, Sludge Bomb, etc.

### Affected Moves

**Water Moves (STAB):**
- Surf, Hydro Pump, Water Pulse, Scald, etc.
- All Water-type moves receive 1.5x damage boost

**Poison Moves (vs Steel):**
- Sludge Bomb, Toxic, Poison Jab, Gunk Shot, etc.
- Hit Steel types for 2x damage instead of immunity
- Can inflict poison status on Steel types

### Strategic Implications

**Offensive Utility:**
- Provides dual-type offensive coverage
- Water moves gain consistent power boost
- Poison moves become viable against Steel walls

**Status Utility:**
- Poison stall strategies work against all types
- Toxic becomes universally applicable
- Breaks traditional type-based immunities

### Example Damage Calculations

**Surf (90 BP) with Acidic Slime:**
- Base: 90 BP
- With STAB: 90 x 1.5 = 135 effective BP

**Sludge Bomb (90 BP) vs Steel type:**
- Normal: 0 damage (immune)
- With Acidic Slime: 90 x 2 = 180 effective BP

### Common Users

This ability is typically found on:
- Poison/Water dual types
- Pokemon with access to both Water and Poison move pools
- Bulky offensive Pokemon that benefit from status spreading

### Competitive Usage

**Strengths:**
- Excellent mixed offensive typing
- Breaks Steel-type defensive cores
- Universal poison spreading capability
- Strong against defensive teams

**Weaknesses:**
- No defensive benefits
- Doesn't boost non-Water/Poison moves
- Still vulnerable to Poison immunity from other sources

### Counters

**Direct Counters:**
- Magic Bounce (reflects status moves)
- Poison Heal (benefits from poison status)
- Natural Cure (removes poison on switch)
- Guts (benefits from status conditions)

**Indirect Counters:**
- Fast offensive Pokemon (bypass slow poison damage)
- Special walls with Poison immunity
- Taunt (prevents status moves)

### Synergies

**Item Synergies:**
- Black Sludge (HP recovery for Poison types)
- Choice items (boost either Water or Poison moves)
- Life Orb (boost both offensive types)

**Move Synergies:**
- Toxic + Water moves for stall
- Scald (Water + burn chance)
- Recovery moves to complement status spreading

**Team Synergies:**
- Toxic Spikes setters
- Pokemon that benefit from weakened Steel types
- Water/Poison offensive core partners
