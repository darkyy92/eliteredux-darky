# Superheavy (N) - Ability ID 848

## In-Game Description
Steadfast + blocks phasing moves.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Getting flinched raises Speed by one stage. Prevents forced switching from moves and Red Card.

## Key Mechanics
- **Flinch Response**: Automatically raises Speed by +1 stage when flinched
- **Phasing Immunity**: Completely blocks forced switching moves (Roar, Whirlwind, etc.)
- **Innate Ability**: Always active as one of three permanent innate abilities
- **Stacking**: Speed boost can stack up to +6 stages with repeated flinches

## Strategy & Usage
Superheavy excels on defensive Pokemon that can absorb hits and punish flinch attempts. The phasing immunity is particularly valuable in competitive play, allowing setup sweepers to boost without fear of being forced out. The Speed increases from flinching can turn a slow tank into a surprisingly fast threat over time.

## Known Pokemon
- Makuhita Redux (Fire/Steel)
- Hariyama Redux (Fire/Steel)

## Interaction Notes
- Speed boosts trigger after the flinch, not before
- Phasing immunity works regardless of weight-based move mechanics
- Does not prevent voluntary switching or pivoting moves
- Works through Substitute for both effects
