# Energized - Ability ID 699

## In-Game Description
"Generator + charges up on KO with an Electric-type move."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Energized charges up the Pokemon on entry or when Electric Terrain is active, like Generator. Additionally charges up when knocking out an opponent with an Electric-type move. Charged status doubles the power of all Electric-type moves until used.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Energized is a hybrid ability that combines the functionality of Generator with an additional trigger for the charged up status. It provides multiple ways to activate the charged up condition, which doubles Electric-type move power.

### Activation Conditions
**Generator Component:**
- **On entry**: Charges up when switching in if Electric Terrain is active OR if this is the first time the ability activates per battle
- **Electric Terrain**: Automatically charges up when Electric Terrain becomes active
- **Single use**: The entry effect only works once per battle (unless terrain is active)

**Energized Component:**
- **KO with Electric move**: Charges up when knocking out an opponent with an Electric-type move
- **Multiple triggers**: Unlike Generator, this KO trigger can activate multiple times per battle

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Energized inherits Generator's onEntry and onTerrain
.onEntry = Generator.onEntry,
.onTerrain = Generator.onTerrain,

// Additional KO trigger for Electric moves
.onBattlerFaints = +[](ON_BATTLER_FAINTS) -> int {
    CHECK(moveType == TYPE_ELECTRIC);
    SetOncePerTurnAbilityCounter(battler, ability, TRUE);
    BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_GeneratorActivatesRet);
    return TRUE;
},
```

### Charged Up Status Effects
- **Electric move boost**: Doubles the power of all Electric-type moves (2.0x multiplier)
- **Consumption**: Status is consumed after using any Electric-type move
- **Visual indicator**: "Pokemon is charging power!" message appears
- **Status3 flag**: Uses STATUS3_CHARGED_UP internal flag

### Important Interactions
- **Terrain synergy**: Works excellently with Electric Terrain setters
- **Move priority**: Charged status applies before move damage calculation
- **Status removal**: Charged status is removed after any Electric move, regardless of success
- **Ability suppression**: Doesn't work if ability is suppressed by Mold Breaker effects
- **Switch out**: Charged status is maintained when switching out (persistent ability)

### Strategic Implications
- **Enhanced Generator**: More reliable than base Generator due to multiple activation methods
- **Momentum building**: KO trigger allows for potential sweeping chains
- **Electric terrain synergy**: Becomes extremely potent on Electric Terrain teams
- **First turn power**: Can charge up immediately on entry in many situations
- **Revenge KO potential**: Can chain KOs with boosted Electric moves

### Optimal Usage
- **Electric Terrain teams**: Pairs excellently with Surge abilities
- **Mixed attackers**: Benefits both physical and special Electric moves equally
- **Late-game cleaners**: KO trigger makes it excellent for end-game scenarios
- **Pivot users**: Can switch in for guaranteed charge, then pivot out while maintaining status

### Counters
- **Priority moves**: Can be revenge killed before using charged moves
- **Non-Electric coverage**: Pokemon may be forced to use non-Electric moves
- **Status moves**: Sleep/paralysis can waste charged turns
- **Terrain override**: Changing terrain prevents terrain-based charging
- **Mold Breaker**: Suppresses the ability entirely

### Synergies
- **Electric Surge**: Guaranteed charging on entry with terrain
- **U-turn/Volt Switch**: Can charge up and maintain status while pivoting
- **Thunder Wave**: Paralyze opponents to ensure charged move connects
- **Magnet Rise**: Avoid Ground moves while setting up charged attacks
- **Choice items**: Maximize damage output of charged moves

### Notable Users
Pokemon with Energized typically have:
- Strong Electric-type movepools
- Mixed offensive capabilities
- Good Speed stats for sweeping
- Ability to switch in safely

### Competitive Viability
- **Tier**: High utility ability for Electric-type specialists
- **Reliability**: More consistent than base Generator
- **Versatility**: Multiple activation methods increase flexibility
- **Power level**: Significant damage boost when active
- **Team support**: Works well in Electric-focused team compositions
