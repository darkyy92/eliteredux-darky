# Ability: Technician

## Basic Information
- **Ability ID**: ABILITY_TECHNICIAN
- **Type**: Offensive Multiplier
- **Breakable**: No

## In-Game Description
"Moves with 60 BP or less get a 1.5x boost."

## Extended In-Game Description
Technician boosts the power of weaker moves by 50%, turning moves with 60 base power or less into viable options. This includes multi-hit moves calculated per hit, priority moves like Bullet Punch and Mach Punch, and utility moves with damage like Rapid Spin. Perfect for sweepers who rely on priority or multi-hit strategies.

Character count: 299

## Detailed Mechanics

### Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Technician = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            if (basePower <= 60) MUL(1.5);
        },
};
```

### Key Mechanics
1. **Power Threshold**: Applies to moves with 60 base power or less
2. **Damage Multiplier**: 1.5x (50% increase)
3. **Multi-hit Calculation**: For multi-hit moves, the check is done per individual hit
4. **Priority Move Synergy**: Many priority moves are low power and benefit from Technician
5. **Hidden Power**: Always benefits regardless of type (base power is 60)

### Affected Move Examples
- **Priority Moves**: Bullet Punch (40→60), Mach Punch (40→60), Quick Attack (40→60)
- **Multi-hit Moves**: Bullet Seed (25→37.5 per hit), Pin Missile (25→37.5 per hit)
- **Utility Moves**: Rapid Spin (50→75), Fake Out (40→60)
- **Coverage Moves**: Hidden Power (60→90), Aerial Ace (60→90)
- **Status Moves**: Doesn't affect status moves (0 base power)

### Notable Interactions
- Works with Skill Link for devastating multi-hit combos
- Stacks with STAB and other damage multipliers
- Does NOT affect moves that have variable power (like Low Kick)
- The 60 BP check happens before other power modifications

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- Turns weak priority moves into legitimate threats
- Excellent on fast physical attackers with priority access
- Makes multi-hit moves extremely powerful with Skill Link
- Provides unique coverage options with boosted weak moves
- Great for revenge killing with boosted priority

### Weaknesses
- No effect on stronger moves (>60 BP)
- Requires specific movepool to utilize effectively
- Less useful on special attackers due to limited low-BP special moves
- Competes with potentially stronger abilities on some Pokemon

### Optimal Users
1. **Scizor**: Bullet Punch becomes a 90 BP priority STAB move
2. **Ambipom**: Fake Out + multi-hit moves with great coverage
3. **Breloom**: Mach Punch and Bullet Seed synergy
4. **Persian**: Wide movepool of low-BP coverage moves
5. **Roserade**: Benefits special moves like Hidden Power and Magical Leaf

### Team Synergy
- Pairs well with entry hazard support for chip damage
- Benefits from speed control to maximize priority abuse
- Works great with Sticky Web teams
- Synergizes with weather teams using weather-boosted low BP moves

## Moveset Examples
