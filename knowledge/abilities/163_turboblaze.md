# Turboblaze - Ability ID 163

## In-Game Description
"Moves bypass all defensive abilities and adds Fire type on entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Turboblaze ignites the user with a blazing aura that burns through enemy defenses while adding Fire typing. Moves bypass all defensive abilities like Levitate, Wonder Guard, and type immunities, ensuring attacks connect. The added Fire type grants STAB to Fire moves and resistances.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Primary Effects
1. **Mold Breaker Effect**: All moves used by the Pokemon ignore the target's defensive abilities that would normally block, reduce, or nullify the move's effects. This includes abilities like Levitate, Flash Fire, Water Absorb, and similar defensive abilities.

2. **Fire Type Addition**: Upon entering battle, the Pokemon gains Fire as an additional type (stored in type3 slot), making it effectively gain Fire-type STAB and Fire-type resistances/weaknesses.

### Technical Implementation
- **Entry Message**: "{Pokemon} is radiating a blazing aura!"
- **Mold Breaker Flag**: Sets HITMARKER_MOLD_BREAKER when attacking, processed by ShouldSetMoldBreaker() function
- **Type Addition**: Uses AddBattlerType(battler, TYPE_FIRE) on entry
- **Battle System**: Checked alongside ABILITY_MOLD_BREAKER and ABILITY_TERAVOLT in ability-ignoring mechanics

## Strategic Applications

### Offensive Benefits
- Bypasses common defensive abilities (Levitate, Flash Fire, Storm Drain, etc.)
- Ignores Wonder Guard on Shedinja-type Pokemon
- Fire-type STAB bonus on Fire moves after gaining the typing
- Crucial for dealing with ability-reliant defensive strategies

### Defensive Considerations  
- Fire typing addition brings new weaknesses (Water, Ground, Rock)
- May lose original type advantages depending on base typing
- Fire resistances to Fire, Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel, and Fairy moves

- **Fire-type specialists**: Rapidash variants, Darumaka line

## Competitive Viability
