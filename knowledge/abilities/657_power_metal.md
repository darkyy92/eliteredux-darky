# Power Metal

**Extended Description:**
Power Metal transforms Normal-type sound moves into Steel-type and boosts all sound-based moves by 20%. This metallic enhancement represents the Pokemon's ability to channel sound waves through steel, creating resonant frequencies that amplify power while hardening sound into metallic vibrations.
