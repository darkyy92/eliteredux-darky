# Power of Alchemy (Ability ID: 223)

## In-Game Description
"Transmutes berries on entry. Transmutes items when lost."

## Extended In-Game Description (280-300 chars)
Upon entry, transmutes opposing Berries into Black Sludge. When any Pokémon loses an item, Power of Alchemy remembers and creates a replacement: regular items are replaced with Black Sludge, or if the target is holding Black Sludge, it's replaced with a Big Nugget.

*Character count: 289*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
**Power of Alchemy** creates a sophisticated "magical item economy" where the user acts as an alchemist, immediately disrupting opposing Berry strategies and continuously transmuting lost items.

### Core Mechanics

#### Transmutation on Entry
When the Pokémon with Power of Alchemy enters battle:
1. **Scans all opposing Pokémon** for held items
2. **Any opponent holding a Berry** gets their Berry instantly transmuted to Black Sludge
3. **Triggers message**: "{Pokémon} transmutes {target}'s lost item!" followed by "It turned into sludge..."
4. **Berry Detection**: Uses `POCKET_BERRIES` check to identify Berries

#### Transmutation When Items Are Lost
The ability tracks when any Pokémon on the field loses an item:
1. **State Tracking**: Uses 2 bits per battler to track what type of item was lost
2. **Loss Detection**: Triggers on `UpdateBattlerItem` calls when items are removed
3. **Replacement Creation**: When the Power of Alchemy user gets a turn after an item loss, it creates a replacement

### Item Transmutation Rules

#### State System Values
- **Value 1**: Creates Black Sludge (sludge transmutation)
- **Value 2**: Creates Big Nugget (gold transmutation)

#### Transmutation Logic
```cpp
// SetPowerOfAlchemyState function logic:
if (lost item is BLACK_SLUDGE || BIG_NUGGET) {
    store value 2;  // Will create Big Nugget
} else {
    store value 1;  // Will create Black Sludge
}
```

#### Item Types and Results
- **Regular items** → Black Sludge
- **Previously transmuted items** (Black Sludge/Big Nugget) → Big Nugget
- **Berries** → Black Sludge (on entry only)

### Item Properties

#### Black Sludge
- **Type**: Poison-type recovery item
- **Effect**: Heals Poison-type Pokémon, damages non-Poison types
- **Strategic Use**: Benefits Poison-types while punishing others

#### Big Nugget
- **Type**: Valuable item
- **Effect**: No battle effect, purely valuable
- **Strategic Use**: End result of repeated transmutation

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
- Uses bit-shifting state management (2 bits per battler)
- State is cleared when items are successfully transmitted
- Tracks losses across the entire battlefield, not just the user

#### Trigger Conditions
- Entry effect uses `onEntry` callback
- Loss tracking uses `UpdateBattlerItem` monitoring
- Replacement creation occurs on the alchemist's next turn

### Strategic Implications

#### Anti-Berry Strategy
- **Immediately counters** opposing Berry strategies (Sitrus, Lum, etc.)
- **Converts beneficial items** into harmful ones for non-Poison types
- **Forces item reconsideration** in team building

#### Battlefield Control
- **Tracks ALL item losses**, not just the user's items
- **Creates item economy** where lost items don't disappear permanently
- **Benefits Poison-type teams** through Black Sludge creation

#### Continuous Value
- **Ongoing effect** throughout the battle
- **Memory system** ensures no item loss goes unrewarded
- **Escalating value** as transmuted items become Big Nuggets

### Unique Features
Power of Alchemy is distinctive because:
1. **Cross-battlefield tracking**: Affects items of ALL Pokémon, not just allies
2. **Item memory**: Remembers losses and acts on them later
3. **Type-specific benefits**: Particularly valuable with Poison-type teams
4. **Economic disruption**: Fundamentally changes item-based strategies

The ability creates a true "alchemical laboratory" environment where the user continuously transforms the battlefield's item economy, punishing Berry strategies while creating value from item losses.
