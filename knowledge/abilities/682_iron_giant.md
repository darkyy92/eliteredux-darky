# Iron Giant - Ability ID 682

## In-Game Description
Heatproof + Juggernaut effects.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Halves damage from Fire-type moves. Immune to burn damage and Attack drops from burn status. Boosts contact moves by adding 20% of the user's Defense stat to attack calculations. Prevents paralysis and immediately cures the status if inflicted on the user.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Iron Giant combines the defensive mastery of Heatproof with the offensive prowess of Juggernaut, creating an unstoppable mechanical behemoth. Fire-type moves deal only half damage, and this titan remains immune to burn damage. Physical contact moves gain 20% of the user's Defense as additional Attack, making each strike exponentially more devastating. Paralysis cannot slow this mechanical monster, and status conditions are instantly cured upon immunity activation.
