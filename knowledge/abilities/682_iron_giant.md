# Iron Giant

Iron Giant combines the defensive mastery of Heatproof with the offensive prowess of Juggernaut, creating an unstoppable mechanical behemoth. Fire-type moves deal only half damage, and this titan remains immune to burn damage. Physical contact moves gain 20% of the user's Defense as additional Attack, making each strike exponentially more devastating. Paralysis cannot slow this mechanical monster, and status conditions are instantly cured upon immunity activation.
