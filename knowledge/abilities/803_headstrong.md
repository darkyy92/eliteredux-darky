# Headstrong - Ability ID 803

## In-Game Description
"+1 Spdef on entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Headstrong raises the Pokemon's Special Defense by one stage when it switches into battle. This defensive boost activates automatically upon entry and can be prevented by abilities like Mold Breaker. The stat boost is permanent until the Pokemon switches out or faints.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Headstrong is a straightforward entry ability that provides an immediate defensive boost upon switching in.

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger**: Activates when the Pokemon switches into battle
- **Effect**: Raises Special Defense by 1 stage (+50% Special Defense)
- **Implementation**: Uses the `onEntry` hook with `CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_SPDEF)` check

### Activation Conditions
- Must switch into battle (not at battle start)
- Special Defense must not already be at maximum (+6 stages)
- Cannot be suppressed by abilities that prevent stat changes

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Headstrong = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_SPDEF))

        SetStatChanger(STAT_SPDEF, 1);
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_BattlerAbilityStatRaiseOnSwitchIn);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,
};
```

### Numerical Values
- **Stat Boost**: +1 stage to Special Defense
- **Percentage Increase**: 50% increase to Special Defense stat
- **Maximum Stages**: Cannot activate if Special Defense is already at +6

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Breakable**: Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker, Teravolt, Turboblaze
- **Mold Breaker Effect**: These abilities ignore Headstrong entirely
- **Clear Body/White Smoke**: Does not prevent Headstrong from activating (it's a self-boost)
- **Contrary**: Would lower Special Defense instead of raising it
- **Simple**: Would raise Special Defense by 2 stages instead of 1

### Strategic Implications
- **Defensive Setup**: Provides immediate bulk against special attacks
- **Switch-In Value**: Makes the Pokemon a reliable special wall from turn 1
- **Momentum**: Allows aggressive switching without losing defensive presence
- **Synergy**: Works well with other defensive abilities and moves

### Example Damage Calculations
With base 100 Special Defense at level 50:
- **No boost**: 120 Special Defense
- **+1 Headstrong**: 180 Special Defense (50% increase)
- **Damage reduction**: Approximately 33% less damage from special attacks

### Common Users
This ability is typically found on:
- Defensive Pokemon designed for special walling
- Pokemon with already high Special Defense stats
- Bulky support Pokemon that benefit from immediate defensive presence

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Entry Hazard Synergy**: Helps mitigate damage from special attacks while setting up
- **Pivot Potential**: Makes switching safer against special attackers
- **Late Game**: Can be crucial for surviving powerful special attacks in endgame scenarios

### Counters
- **Mold Breaker variants**: Completely bypass the ability
- **Physical attacks**: Doesn't boost Defense, vulnerable to physical moves
- **Stat-lowering moves**: Can be neutralized by moves like Psychic Noise or abilities like Intimidate (though that affects Attack)
- **Haze/Clear Smog**: Removes the stat boost after activation

### Synergies
- **Assault Vest**: Stacks with the Special Defense boost for extreme special bulk
- **Calm Mind**: Can further boost Special Defense and Special Attack
- **Recover/Roost**: Healing moves work well with the improved bulk
- **Leftovers**: Passive recovery complements the defensive nature

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Introduced as a new ability providing reliable entry-based Special Defense boosts
- **Current Status**: Active ability in the current build
