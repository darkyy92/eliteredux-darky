# No Turning Back - Ability ID 668

## In-Game Description
When HP drops to 50% or below, all stats increase by one stage while becoming trapped in battle.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When HP drops to half or below for the first time, all stats increase by one stage and the user becomes unable to switch out or flee. Normal ways to bypass this effects such as Eject Button or Shed Shell still allow switching out.
