# Psychic Mind

**Ability ID:** 343  
**Type:** Offensive Multiplier  
**Activation:** HP-based threshold  

## Overview

Psychic Mind is a signature ability that enhances the power of Psychic-type moves based on the user's remaining HP. This ability follows the classic "pinch ability" pattern, providing moderate enhancement at full health that dramatically increases when the user becomes desperate.

## Mechanics

### Damage Calculation
- **Normal state (HP > 1/3):** Psychic-type moves deal **1.2x damage** (20% increase)
- **Pinch state (HP ≤ 1/3):** Psychic-type moves deal **1.5x damage** (50% increase)

### Technical Implementation
**File:** `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`  
**Line:** 3627-3629

```cpp
constexpr Ability PsychicMind = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = SWARM_MULTIPLIER(TYPE_PSYCHIC),
};
```

The ability uses the `SWARM_MULTIPLIER` macro with `TYPE_PSYCHIC`, defined at lines 293-301:

```cpp
#define SWARM_MULTIPLIER(type)                                               \
    +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {                                           \
        if (moveType == type) {                                              \
            if (gBattleMons[battler].hp <= (gBattleMons[battler].maxHP / 3)) \
                MUL(1.5);                                                    \
            else                                                             \
                MUL(1.2);                                                    \
        }                                                                    \
    }
```

### Key Mechanics
- Only affects **outgoing damage** from Psychic-type moves
- HP threshold check: `current HP ≤ (max HP ÷ 3)`
- Stacks multiplicatively with other damage modifiers
- Active on both physical and special Psychic-type moves

## Strategic Applications

### Offensive Strategy
- **Early game:** Provides consistent 20% damage boost to Psychic moves
- **Late game/Pinch situations:** Transforms into a powerful 50% damage boost
- **Sweeping potential:** Combines well with high Special Attack Psychic-types
- **Revenge killing:** Low HP trigger makes weakened Pokemon dangerous

### Defensive Considerations
- Opponents may avoid bringing the user to low HP to prevent the boost
- Creates mindgames around healing vs. maintaining pinch state
- Works well with strategies that intentionally lower HP (Substitute, Life Orb)

### Synergistic Items
- **Life Orb:** Accelerates reaching pinch state while boosting damage further
- **Focus Sash:** Guarantees survival to trigger maximum boost
- **Sitrus Berry:** Can heal out of pinch range when strategic
- **Choice items:** Maximize the boosted damage output

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- **Consistent boost:** Always provides at least 20% damage increase
- **Pinch power:** 50% boost in desperate situations is significant
- **Wide coverage:** Affects all Psychic-type moves
- **Mind games:** Creates prediction layers in battle

### Limitations
- **Type-specific:** Only affects one type of move
- **HP dependent:** Requires taking damage for maximum benefit
- **No defensive utility:** Purely offensive ability
- **Predictable:** Opponents know when boost is active

### Usage Tiers
**Tier 4 (Standard):** Solid ability for Psychic-type attackers  
**Tier 3 (Competitive):** Strong on Pokemon with diverse Psychic movesets  
**Tier 2 (High-level):** Excellent on specialized Psychic sweepers

## Interactions

### Battle Mechanics
- **Critical hits:** Boost applies before critical hit calculation
- **Type immunity:** No effect if Psychic move doesn't affect target
- **Multi-hit moves:** Each hit gets the boost
- **STAB:** Stacks multiplicatively with Same Type Attack Bonus

### Status Conditions
