# Propeller Tail - Ability ID 239

## In-Game Description
"Swift Swim + Redirection Immunity."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Propeller Tail boosts the Pokemon's Speed by 50% during rain weather and grants immunity to redirection effects. The speed boost works in all forms of rain. Redirection immunity prevents opponents from using abilities like Lightning Rod or Storm Drain to redirect moves away from their intended target.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Propeller Tail is a combination ability that provides two distinct effects:

### Swift Swim Component
- Increases Speed stat by 50% (multiplier of 1.5) when rain weather is active
- Activates during any form of rain weather (regular rain, heavy rain, Primordial Sea)
- The speed boost applies immediately when rain becomes active and disappears when rain ends
- Stacks multiplicatively with other speed modifiers like Choice Scarf or speed stages

### Redirection Immunity Component
- Prevents the Pokemon's moves from being redirected by opponent abilities
- Immunity applies to all redirection abilities including:
  - Lightning Rod (Electric-type moves)
  - Storm Drain (Water-type moves)
  - Sap Sipper (Grass-type moves)
  - Flash Fire (Fire-type moves)
  - Water Absorb (Water-type moves)
  - Volt Absorb (Electric-type moves)
  - Motor Drive (Electric-type moves)
  - And other custom redirection abilities in Elite Redux

### Technical Implementation
- The ability uses the same `onStat` function as Swift Swim for the speed boost
- Redirection immunity is implemented in the `HasRedirectionAbility` function in battle_util.c
- When a Pokemon with Propeller Tail attacks, `HasRedirectionAbility` returns `ABILITY_NONE`, preventing redirection
- This immunity works similarly to the moves that naturally bypass redirection (like Snipe Shot)

### Strategic Applications
- Excellent for fast Rain Dance sweepers that need guaranteed target accuracy
- Prevents opponents from using redirection abilities to protect frail teammates
- Particularly useful in doubles battles where redirection is more common
- The combination makes it ideal for fast, precise attackers in rain teams

### Pokemon with Propeller Tail
This ability is typically found on aquatic Pokemon with propeller-like tails or fins, reflecting both the speed boost in rain and the precision targeting theme.
