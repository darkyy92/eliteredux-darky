# Deep Cuts - Ability ID 736

## In-Game Description
"Slashing moves have a 50% chance to inflict bleeding."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Deep Cuts gives all slashing moves a 50% chance to inflict bleeding on hit. Bleeding causes 1/16 max HP damage each turn until healed. Only affects moves with the Keen Edge flag like Slash, Fury Cutter, and Razor Wind. Rock and Ghost types are immune to bleeding.

*Character count: 295*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Deep Cuts is an offensive ability that adds a bleeding status effect to slashing moves. When the user lands a slashing attack, there's a 50% chance the target will begin bleeding.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move requirement**: The move must have the `FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST` flag (slashing moves)
- **Hit requirement**: The move must successfully hit and deal damage
- **Status requirement**: Target must be able to receive bleeding status
- **Probability**: 50% chance per eligible move hit

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability DeepCuts = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(target))
        CHECK(CanBleed(target))
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].flags & FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST)
        CHECK(Random() % 2)

        return AbilityStatusEffect(MOVE_EFFECT_BLEED);
    },
};
```

### Bleeding Status Effect
- **Damage**: 1/16 of max HP per turn (`BLEED_DAMAGE(hp) = hp / 16`)
- **Duration**: Until healed or switched out
- **Timing**: Damage occurs at end of turn
- **Minimum damage**: Always at least 1 HP if bleeding

### Eligible Moves
Deep Cuts works with all moves that have the `FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST` flag, including:
- **Slash**: Basic slashing move
- **Fury Cutter**: Consecutive slashing attack
- **Razor Wind**: Two-turn slashing move
- **Night Slash**: Dark-type slashing move
- **Psycho Cut**: Psychic-type slashing move
- **Air Slash**: Flying-type slashing move
- **Sacred Sword**: Fighting-type blade move
- **Leaf Blade**: Grass-type cutting move
- And many others with the Keen Edge designation

### Bleeding Immunity
Certain Pokémon types cannot be affected by bleeding:
- **Rock types**: Cannot bleed due to mineral composition
- **Ghost types**: Cannot bleed due to incorporeal nature
- **Pokémon with status**: Cannot receive bleeding if already statused
- **Status immunity**: Pokémon with abilities that prevent status

### Important Interactions
- **Status immunity**: Doesn't work on Pokémon with status immunity abilities
- **Magic Guard**: Prevents bleeding damage but not the status itself
- **Healing**: Bleeding can be cured by items, moves, or switching out
- **Stacking**: Cannot stack with other major status conditions
- **Multi-hit moves**: Each hit has separate 50% chance to inflict bleeding

### Strategic Applications
- **Pressure damage**: Forces opponents to heal or switch frequently
- **Stallbreaking**: Counters defensive strategies with gradual damage
- **Finisher potential**: Can secure KOs on weakened opponents
- **Team support**: Provides chip damage for team cleanup
- **Status spreading**: Forces opponents to use healing resources

### Counters and Limitations
- **Type immunity**: Rock and Ghost types are completely immune
- **Status immunity**: Abilities like Limber, Water Veil prevent bleeding
- **Healing items**: Pecha Berry, Full Heal cure bleeding immediately
- **Natural Cure**: Ability removes bleeding when switching out
- **Cleric support**: Heal Bell and Aromatherapy cure bleeding
- **Non-slashing moves**: Ability only works with Keen Edge flagged moves

### Synergies
- **Keen Edge**: Boosts damage of same moves that can cause bleeding
- **Choice items**: Locked slashing moves maximize bleeding chances
- **Multi-hit moves**: Increases bleeding application opportunities
- **Pursuit**: Can punish bleeding Pokémon trying to switch
- **Entry hazards**: Combines with Stealth Rock for maximum pressure

### Competitive Usage
- **Physical attackers**: Best on Pokémon with strong slashing movesets
- **Pressure builds**: Excellent for wearing down bulky opponents
- **Anti-stall**: Counters defensive teams that rely on recovery
- **Hit-and-run**: Good for Pokémon that can switch after applying bleeding
- **Revenge killing**: Bleeding can finish off weakened sweepers

### Team Building Considerations
- **Move selection**: Prioritize slashing moves in moveset
- **Coverage**: Ensure access to multiple slashing move types
- **Speed tiers**: Faster Pokémon apply bleeding more reliably
- **Support**: Pair with entry hazards and other chip damage
- **Healing**: Team should pressure opponents' healing resources

### Version History
- Added in Elite Redux as part of expanded ability roster
- Unique status-inflicting ability for physical attackers
- Designed to provide alternative to standard status moves
