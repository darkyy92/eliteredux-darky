# Low Visibility - Ability ID 619

## In-Game Description
"Automatically summons Eerie Fog weather upon entry, lasting 8 turns."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Automatically summons Eerie Fog weather upon entry, lasting 8 turns. This supernatural mist drains stat boosts from non-Ghost and non-Psychic Pokemon each turn while reducing damage taken by Ghost types by 20%. Also weakens Solar Beam and enables synergies with fog-boosted abilities like Ectoplasm.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Core Mechanics
Low Visibility automatically summons **Eerie Fog** weather upon switching in, lasting 8 turns. This creates a supernatural battlefield condition that affects multiple aspects of battle.

### Fog Weather Effects

### Stat Boost Drainage
- **Primary Effect**: Drains stat boosts from non-Ghost and non-Psychic type Pokemon each turn
- Ghost and Psychic types are immune to this effect
- Affects all stat modifications (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.)

### Combat Modifications
- **Ghost Defense Boost**: Ghost-type Pokemon take 20% less damage (0.8x multiplier) while in fog
- **Move Targeting**: Curse becomes a targeting move for non-Ghost types instead of self-targeting
- **Solar Beam**: Power reduced by 50% in fog weather
- **Specific Moves**: Some moves receive double damage in fog conditions

### Ability Synergies
Multiple abilities gain enhanced effects in fog weather:
- **Ectoplasm**: Boosts highest attacking stat by 1.5x in fog
- **Greater Spirit**: Raises highest stat by one stage on entry if in fog
- **Ethereal Rush**: Increases Speed by 1.5x in fog
- **Peaceful Rest**: Heals 1/8 max HP per turn in fog
- **Smokey Maneuvers**: Reduces opponent accuracy by 25% in fog
- **Soul Tap**: Damages all opposing Pokemon at end of turn in fog
- **Surprise**: Enables priority move redirection in fog

### Strategic Applications

### Offensive Usage
- **Support Role**: Weakens opposing setup sweepers by draining their stat boosts
- **Type Synergy**: Pairs excellently with Ghost and Psychic teammates who benefit from fog
- **Ability Combinations**: Maximizes effectiveness when paired with fog-boosted abilities

### Defensive Applications
- **Setup Prevention**: Nullifies opposing stat-boosting strategies
- **Weather Control**: Overwrites opposing weather conditions
- **Terrain Denial**: Can be used to disrupt opponent's weather-based strategies

### Counterplay Considerations
- **Type Immunity**: Ghost and Psychic types are unaffected by stat drain
- **Weather Override**: Can be replaced by other weather-setting moves or abilities
- **Primal Weather**: Blocked by Primal Weather conditions (Desolate Land, Primordial Sea, Delta Stream)

### Competitive Viability
Low Visibility serves as a potent anti-setup tool that creates a unique battlefield environment favoring Ghost and Psychic types. Its automatic activation makes it excellent for disrupting opponent strategies while enabling powerful fog-based synergies with appropriate team compositions.
