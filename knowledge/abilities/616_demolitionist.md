# Demolitionist

Grants priority on the first turn after switching in (Readied Action effect). While in readied state, completely ignores all Protect-type moves and automatically shatters Light Screen, Reflect, and Aurora Veil when hitting opponents with physical or special attacks. Powerful battlefield control.
