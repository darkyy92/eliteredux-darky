"Grants priority on first turn and ignores Protect-type moves while breaking screens."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Demolitionist is a powerful battlefield control ability that provides both offensive priority and screen-breaking capabilities, making it excellent for breaking through defensive strategies.

### Core Mechanics
- **Readied Action**: Priority on first turn after switching in
- **Protect Immunity**: Completely ignores all Protect-type moves while readied
- **Screen Breaking**: Automatically destroys Light Screen, Reflect, and Aurora Veil on hit
- **Universal Application**: Works with both physical and special attacks

### Strategic Applications
- **Lead Pressure**: Guaranteed priority move on switch-in
- **Defensive Counter**: Breaks through Protect strategies
- **Screen Removal**: Eliminates opponent's defensive screens
- **Momentum Control**: Forces favorable exchanges through priority

### Notable Interactions
- **One-Time Effect**: Priority only applies to first move after switch-in
- **Screen Destruction**: Triggers on any successful hit while readied
- **Protect Bypass**: Ignores Protect, Detect, King's Shield, etc.
- **Status Independence**: Works regardless of move type or category
