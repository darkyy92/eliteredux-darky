# Speed Boost - Ability ID 3

## In-Game Description
"Raises own Speed by one stage after every turn."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Speed Boost raises the user's Speed by one stage at the end of each turn they remain on the field. Does not activate on the turn of entry or when switching in. Continues until reaching maximum Speed (+6 stages). Creates powerful momentum in extended battles.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**SPEED BOOST** is a passive turn-based ability that provides incremental Speed boosts over time.

### Activation Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: End of turn (onEndTurn hook)
- **Timing**: After all actions, damage, and other end-of-turn effects
- **Switch-in Rule**: Does NOT activate on the turn the Pokémon enters battle (isFirstTurn != 2 check)
- **Requirement**: The Pokémon must remain active for the entire turn
- **Script**: Uses BattleScript_AttackerAbilityStatRaiseEnd3 for the "+1 Speed!" message

### Speed Stage Mechanics:
1. **Boost Amount**: Always +1 stage per turn
2. **Maximum Cap**: Stops at +6 Speed stages (MAX_STAT_STAGE = 12, default = 6)
3. **Stage Effects**: Each stage = 50% Speed increase (1.5x, 2x, 2.5x, 3x, 3.5x, 4x total)
4. **Persistence**: Boosts remain through Baton Pass but reset on switch-out

### Turn-by-Turn Progression:
- **Turn 1**: Entry - No boost (isFirstTurn = 2, decrements to 1)
- **Turn 2**: Active - No boost (isFirstTurn = 1, decrements to 0) 
- **Turn 3**: Active - First +1 Speed boost (isFirstTurn = 0)
- **Turn 4+**: +1 Speed per turn until +6 maximum

### Interaction Rules:
- **vs Clear Body/White Smoke**: Speed Boost bypasses stat reduction immunity
- **vs Contrary**: Boosts become Speed drops instead
- **vs Simple**: Each boost becomes +2 stages instead of +1
- **vs Unaware**: Speed Boost still affects turn order despite Unaware ignoring stat changes for damage
- **Baton Pass**: Speed stages transfer to the next Pokémon
- **Haze/Clear Smog**: Resets accumulated Speed boosts to 0

### Special Interactions:
- **Quick Claw/Speed Items**: Still trigger normally with boosted Speed
- **Trick Room**: Higher Speed becomes a disadvantage, making Speed Boost counterproductive
- **Tailwind**: Stacks multiplicatively with Speed Boost stages (both affect final Speed)
- **Choice Scarf**: Stacks multiplicatively (1.5x item × stage multiplier)

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability SpeedBoost = {
    .onEndTurn = +[](ON_END_TURN) -> int {
        CHECK(gVolatileStructs[battler].isFirstTurn != 2)
        CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, STAT_SPEED, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER, NULL))

        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_AttackerAbilityStatRaiseEnd3);
        gBattleScripting.battler = battler;
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Competitive Notes:
- **Setup Sweeper**: Excellent for Pokémon with strong offensive moves but mediocre initial Speed
- **Late Game Power**: Becomes increasingly threatening as battle duration extends
- **Priority Weakness**: Fast setup vulnerable to priority moves early on
- **Switch Prediction**: Opponents often force switches to reset Speed accumulation
- **Meta Impact**: Shapes team building around either supporting Speed Boost users or countering them

### Notable Users in Elite Redux:
- **Blaziken Line**: Mixed attacker that becomes progressively faster
- **Yanmega**: Special attacker with Tinted Lens + Speed Boost combination
- **Ninjask**: Pure Speed Boost + Baton Pass support
- **Sharpedo**: Hyper Offensive sweeper with Speed Boost momentum
- **Mega Blaziken**: Retains Speed Boost with enhanced offensive stats

### Version History:
- Gen 3: Introduction with Ninjask and Blaziken lines
- Gen 4+: Became highly valued in competitive play
- Elite Redux: Unchanged mechanics, but many new Pokémon gain access
