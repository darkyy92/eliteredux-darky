# Generator - Ability ID 477

## In-Game Description
"Charges up once on entry or when electric terrain is active."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Generator charges up the Pokemon once upon switching in, doubling Electric-type move power for the next Electric attack. Can recharge when Electric Terrain becomes active during battle. The charged state is lost upon switching out but can be regained with terrain activation.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Generator is an offensive ability that provides a powerful one-time boost to Electric-type moves. The ability grants the "charged up" status which doubles the power of the next Electric-type move used.

### Activation Conditions
- **Entry activation**: Charges up once automatically when switching into battle
- **Terrain activation**: Recharges when Electric Terrain becomes active
- **Single use**: Each charge is consumed after using an Electric-type move
- **Persistent**: The ability continues working across turns until switched out

### Power Mechanics
- **Damage multiplier**: 2.0x power boost to Electric-type moves
- **Status requirement**: Must have STATUS3_CHARGED_UP status active
- **Move requirement**: Only applies to Electric-type attacking moves
- **Consumption**: Status is removed after using an Electric-type move

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Generator activates on entry or Electric Terrain
constexpr Ability Generator = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(gStatuses3[battler] & STATUS3_CHARGED_UP)
        
        int any = FALSE;
        if (IsTerrainActive(STATUS_FIELD_ELECTRIC_TERRAIN)) {
            any = TRUE;
        } else if (!GetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability)) {
            SetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability, TRUE);
            any = TRUE;
        }
        
        CHECK(any)
        gStackBattler1 = battler;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_GeneratorActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onTerrain = +[](ON_TERRAIN) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(gStatuses3[battler] & STATUS3_CHARGED_UP)
        CHECK(IsTerrainActive(STATUS_FIELD_ELECTRIC_TERRAIN))
        
        gStackBattler1 = battler;
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_GeneratorActivatesRet);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onExit = +[](ON_EXIT) -> int {
        CHECK(gStatuses3[battler] & STATUS3_CHARGED_UP)
        SetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability, FALSE);
        return FALSE;
    },
    .persistent = TRUE,
};

// Damage calculation includes charged up bonus
if (gStatuses3[battlerAtk] & STATUS3_CHARGED_UP && moveType == TYPE_ELECTRIC) 
    MulModifier(&modifier, UQ_4_12(2.0));
```

### Terrain Interaction
- **Electric Terrain synergy**: Can recharge multiple times if terrain is repeatedly set
- **Terrain timing**: Activates when terrain becomes active, not just when present
- **Multiple activations**: Unlike entry activation, terrain activation can occur multiple times
- **Priority**: Electric Terrain setters disable Generator's entry activation to prevent double charging

### Important Interactions
- **Single-use counter**: Entry activation is limited to once per switch-in
- **Terrain recharging**: Electric Terrain can recharge the ability even after use
- **Switch reset**: Counter resets when switching out, allowing reactivation on re-entry
- **Move consumption**: Charged status is consumed when using any Electric-type move
- **Power stacking**: Stacks multiplicatively with other damage modifiers

### Ability Suppression
- **Mold Breaker effects**: Cannot bypass Generator's charging mechanism
- **Neutralizing Gas**: Prevents charging while active
- **Gastro Acid**: Disables the ability but doesn't remove existing charge
- **Simple Beam**: Replaces ability and removes charged status

### Strategic Implications
- **Immediate threat**: Creates instant offensive pressure upon switch-in
- **Terrain synergy**: Excellent on Electric Terrain teams for multiple charges
- **One-shot potential**: Can secure crucial KOs with doubled Electric moves
- **Prediction based**: Opponents must respect potential doubled damage
- **Resource management**: Timing Electric moves becomes crucial

### Common Users
- Electric-type attackers with powerful Electric moves
- Pokemon with access to high BP Electric moves (Thunderbolt, Thunder, etc.)
- Mixed attackers who can utilize both physical and special Electric moves
- Terrain team supporters who benefit from Electric Terrain

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Entry hazard immunity**: Not affected by entry hazards unlike other entry abilities
- **Immediate impact**: Unlike setup moves, provides instant power boost
- **Terrain team core**: Essential ability for Electric Terrain strategies
- **Wallbreaking**: Can break through typical Electric-type resists with doubled power
- **Priority moves**: Works with Electric-type priority moves like Thunder Wave (damage dealing)

### Optimal Movesets
- **High power Electric moves**: Thunderbolt, Discharge, Thunder
- **STAB Electric types**: Maximizes damage potential with STAB + Generator
- **Mixed coverage**: Physical and special Electric moves for versatility
- **Terrain setting**: Moves like Electric Terrain for self-recharging

### Counters
- **Ground-type immunity**: Completely immune to Electric-type moves
- **Lightning Rod/Motor Drive**: Redirects or absorbs Electric attacks
- **Volt Absorb**: Heals from Electric-type moves instead of taking damage
- **Ability changing**: Simple Beam, Worry Seed remove the charging capability
- **Weather override**: Weather Ball users can avoid Electric-type attacks

### Synergies
- **Electric Terrain**: Essential for multiple charges and team support
- **Thunder**: Perfect accuracy in rain combines with doubled power
- **Choice items**: Can be used with Choice Band/Specs for massive damage
- **Life Orb**: Stacks multiplicatively for extreme power
- **Magnet**: Boosts Electric moves further when combined with charge

### Related Abilities
- **Energized**: Enhanced version that also charges on Electric-type KOs
- **Battery**: Team support that boosts Special Attack for Electric moves
- **Electric Surge**: Sets Electric Terrain to enable recharging
- **Motor Drive**: Immunity to Electric moves that would otherwise be boosted
