# Honey Gather - Ability ID 118

## In-Game Description
"Has a 50% chance to find Honey each turn."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Honey Gather gives a 50% chance to find a Honey item at the end of each turn, but only if the Pokemon is not already holding an item. Honey restores 20 HP when consumed and can be sold for 100 Poké Dollars. Excellent for resource gathering and emergency healing in longer battles.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**HONEY GATHER** is a utility ability that provides consistent item generation for resource management and emergency healing.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: End of each turn
- **Activation Rate**: 50% chance per turn
- **Requirement**: Pokemon must not be holding an item
- **Item Generated**: Honey (ITEM_HONEY)
- **Honey Properties**: Restores 20 HP when consumed, sells for 100 Poké Dollars

### Activation Conditions:
1. **Turn End Trigger**: Activates during the end-of-turn phase
2. **No Item Requirement**: Pokemon must have an empty item slot
3. **Random Check**: 50% probability using the game's random number generator
4. **Success**: Pokemon receives a Honey item that can be used immediately

### Item Details - Honey:
- **Healing**: Restores 20 HP when consumed
- **Monetary Value**: Can be sold for 100 Poké Dollars
- **Usage**: Can be consumed during battle for emergency healing
- **Inventory**: Transfers to bag if gained outside battle

### Strategic Applications:
**Resource Generation**:
- Consistent income source through Honey sales
- Emergency healing item for extended battles
- Useful for Pokemon without reliable recovery moves

**Synergies**:
- Pairs well with item-consuming moves or abilities
- Benefits Pokemon that frequently use their held items
- Good on defensive Pokemon that can survive to generate multiple items

**Limitations**:
- Requires empty item slot to activate
- 50% chance means inconsistent activation
- Honey provides modest healing compared to other items
- No benefit if Pokemon already holds a better item

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability HoneyGather = {
    .onEndTurn = +[](ON_END_TURN) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(gBattleMons[battler].item)  // Must not hold item
        CHECK(Random() % 2)                   // 50% chance
        
        gBattleMons[battler].item = gLastUsedItem = ITEM_HONEY;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_HoneyGatherActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Competitive Viability:
**Pros**:
- Passive resource generation
- No setup required
- Works consistently throughout battle
- Provides both healing and monetary value

**Cons**:
- Requires giving up held item slot
- 50% activation rate can be unreliable
- Modest healing amount (20 HP)
- Competes with more powerful abilities

### Optimal Users:
- Defensive Pokemon that can survive multiple turns
- Pokemon without access to reliable recovery moves
- Team members used primarily for utility rather than combat
- Pokemon in casual play where resource management matters

### Comparison to Similar Abilities:
- **Pickup**: Activates after battle, can find various items
- **Harvest**: Restores consumed Berries, more reliable for healing
- **Frisk**: Reveals opponent items but doesn't generate resources

### Historical Context:
Honey Gather originated as a primarily overworld ability in the main series games, with different mechanics for in-battle vs. out-of-battle activation. In Elite Redux, it's been adapted as a consistent in-battle utility ability focused on resource generation and emergency healing.
