# Receiver - Ability ID 222

## In-Game Description
"In Double Battles, copies its fainting partner's ability."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Receiver activates only in Double Battles when an ally faints. It copies the fainted ally's ability, replacing one of Receiver user's current abilities. Cannot copy Wonder Guard, Trace, or another Receiver ability. The copied ability functions normally and persists until switched out.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Receiver is a situational ability that only functions in Double Battles, Multi Battles, and other team-based formats. When an ally Pokemon faints, Receiver triggers and attempts to copy that ally's ability.

### Activation Conditions
- **Battle Format**: Only works in Double Battles, Multi Battles, or other formats with allies
- **Trigger**: An ally Pokemon must faint while the Receiver user is still active
- **Timing**: Activates immediately when the ally faints, before any other end-of-turn effects

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Receiver = {
    .onBattlerFaints = +[](ON_BATTLER_FAINTS) -> int {
        AbilityEnum allyAbility = GetBattlerAbility(fainted);
        CHECK_NOT(IsRolePlayBannedAbility(allyAbility))
        CHECK_NOT(HasAbilityIgnoringSuppression(battler, allyAbility))
        int index = GetAbilityIndex(battler, ability, FALSE);
        CHECK(index < TOTAL_ABILITY_COUNT)

        gBattleMons[battler].abilities[index] = allyAbility;
        gVolatileStructs[battler].switchInAbilityDone[index] = FALSE;

        gBattleScripting.abilityPopupOverwrite = allyAbility;
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_ReceiverActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ALLY,
};
```

### Banned Abilities (Cannot Be Copied)
According to `sRolePlayBannedAbilities` array:
- **Trace**: Prevents ability copying loops
- **Wonder Guard**: Too powerful to be copyable
- **Receiver**: Prevents infinite ability copying chains
- **Any persistent/unsuppressable abilities**: Technical limitation

### Ability Replacement Mechanics
- **Elite Redux Multi-Ability System**: Receiver replaces one of the user's current abilities
- **Index Selection**: Uses `GetAbilityIndex()` to determine which ability slot to replace
- **Persistence**: The copied ability remains until the Pokemon switches out
- **Switch-In Effects**: The copied ability can trigger switch-in effects if applicable

### Strategic Implications
- **Team Synergy**: Allows strategic ability sharing between teammates
- **Risk/Reward**: Requires sacrificing an ally to gain their ability
- **Versatility**: Can adapt to different situations based on team composition
- **Doubles Meta**: Primarily useful in competitive doubles formats

### Common Users
- **Kecleon**: Natural user with Color Change synergy
- **Passimian**: Fighting-type with team-oriented movepool

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Doubles Strategy**: Plan team composition to maximize copied ability value
- **Timing Considerations**: Can be used defensively to save a powerful ability
- **Ability Priority**: Consider which abilities are most valuable to copy
- **Format Limitations**: Useless in Singles format

### Counters
- **Singles Format**: Completely inactive in 1v1 battles
- **Ability Suppression**: Neutralizing Gas, etc. prevent activation
- **Priority Switching**: Removing the Receiver user before allies faint

### Synergies
- **Powerful Abilities**: Copying meta-defining abilities like Intimidate
- **Entry Hazards**: Copying abilities that benefit from switching
- **Weather/Terrain**: Copying setup abilities for field control

### Version History
- Introduced in Generation VII
- Elite Redux implementation allows multi-ability integration
- Enhanced with role-play banning system for balance
