# Rampage - Ability ID 275

## In-Game Description
"No recharge after a KO, if it usually would need to recharge."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Rampage eliminates the recharge turn required after using powerful moves like Hyper Beam and Giga Impact, but only when the user successfully KOs an opponent. This allows for devastating sweep potential with high-power moves that normally leave the user vulnerable.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Rampage is a powerful ability that removes the recharge limitation from moves with the `EFFECT_RECHARGE` mechanic when the user successfully KOs an opponent.

### Activation Conditions
- The Pokemon with Rampage must use a move that normally requires recharge (Hyper Beam, Giga Impact)
- The move must successfully KO the target
- When both conditions are met, the recharge requirement is completely removed

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Rampage = {
    .onBattlerFaints = +[](ON_BATTLER_FAINTS) -> int {
        SetAbilityState(battler, ability, TRUE);
        gVolatileStructs[battler].rechargeTimer = 0;
        gBattleMons[battler].status2 &= ~(STATUS2_RECHARGE);
        return FALSE;
    },
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ATTACKER,
};
```

The ability triggers when an opponent faints and:
1. Sets the recharge timer to 0
2. Removes the `STATUS2_RECHARGE` flag
3. Allows the user to act normally on the next turn

### Affected Moves
Currently in Elite Redux, only two moves have the `EFFECT_RECHARGE` mechanic:
- **Hyper Beam** (Special, 150 BP, Normal-type)
- **Giga Impact** (Physical, 150 BP, Normal-type)

### Normal Recharge Mechanics
Without Rampage, recharge moves work as follows:
- Move hits and deals damage
- User gains `STATUS2_RECHARGE` status
- `rechargeTimer` is set to 2 turns
- User cannot act on the following turn
- Recharge status is removed after the forced rest turn

### Strategic Implications
- **Late-game sweeping**: Excellent for cleaning up weakened teams
- **Momentum preservation**: Maintains offensive pressure without vulnerability windows
- **Risk management**: Allows safe use of powerful moves when securing KOs
- **Team positioning**: Works best when opponents are already in KO range

### Example Scenarios
1. **Successful KO**: Dragonite uses Hyper Beam to KOs opponent to Can act immediately next turn
2. **Failed KO**: Dragonite uses Hyper Beam to Opponent survives to Must recharge next turn
3. **Multi-KO potential**: With proper setup, can chain multiple Hyper Beams without recharge

### Interactions with Other Mechanics
- **Choice items**: Still locked into the same move, but no recharge penalty
- **Parental Bond**: Each hit can potentially trigger Rampage if it secures a KO
- **Life Orb**: Recoil damage still applies, but no recharge if KO is secured
- **Substitute**: Does not interfere with Rampage activation

### Common Users in Elite Redux
Notable Pokemon that can have Rampage:
- **Nidoking**: Physical/Special mixed attacker with Sheer Force synergy
- **Aerodactyl**: High-speed physical sweeper with Rock Head
- **Gyarados**: Intimidate support with late-game sweep potential
- **Dragonite**: Multiple forms with Multiscale and Overwhelm support
- **Cranidos**: Early-game physical powerhouse with Sheer Force
- **Genesect**: Legendary with Neuroforce and Beast Boost synergy
- **Blissey**: Unexpected special tank with Pixilate and Magic Bounce

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Tier placement**: Primarily found on Tier 2-3 Pokemon for balance
- **Role compression**: Allows bulky attackers to also serve as late-game cleaners
- **Meta positioning**: Counters defensive stall strategies
- **Speed requirements**: Most effective on naturally fast Pokemon or with speed control

### Counters and Counterplay
- **Residual damage**: Sandstorm, Toxic, etc. can prevent clean KOs
- **Focus Sash/Sturdy**: Prevents one-shot KOs that would trigger Rampage
- **Substitute**: Blocks the initial attack and prevents KO
- **Priority moves**: Can revenge kill before Rampage user acts again
- **Status conditions**: Sleep, paralysis can limit follow-up potential

### Synergies
- **Life Orb**: Increased damage helps secure KOs despite recoil
- **Choice Band/Specs**: Massive power increase for guaranteed KOs
- **Moxie**: Attack boosts stack with Rampage for increasing sweep potential
- **Dragon Dance/Nasty Plot**: Setup sweeping becomes more reliable
- **Multiscale/Sturdy**: Defensive abilities help survive to use powerful moves

### Version History
- Added in Elite Redux as part of the expanded ability system
- Designed to make recharge moves more viable in competitive play
- Currently paired with various legendary and pseudo-legendary Pokemon
- Balanced by limiting to specific Pokemon rather than reducing the effect
