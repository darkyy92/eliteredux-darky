# Magical Dust - Ability ID 304

## In-Game Description
"If hit by a contact move, gives Psychic type to the attacker."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When hit by a contact move, converts the attacker to Psychic type. This typing change affects damage calculations and resistances immediately. The attacker becomes vulnerable to Dark moves while gaining resistance to Fighting and Psychic moves. Only works on non-Psychic attackers.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger**: Activates when the Pokemon with this ability is hit by a contact move
- **Effect**: Adds Psychic typing to the attacking Pokemon by setting their `type3` field
- **Duration**: Permanent for the battle (until the attacker switches out)
- **Type System**: Uses Elite Redux's enhanced typing system where Pokemon can have up to 3 types

### Activation Conditions
1. The Pokemon with Magical Dust must be hit by a move
2. The move must make contact (`IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker)` returns true)
3. The move must successfully hit and deal damage (`ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(attacker)` returns true)
4. The attacker must not already be Psychic-type (`IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE(attacker, TYPE_PSYCHIC)` returns false)

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability MagicalDust = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(attacker))
        CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker))
        CHECK_NOT(IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE(attacker, TYPE_PSYCHIC))

        gBattleMons[attacker].type3 = TYPE_PSYCHIC;
        PREPARE_TYPE_BUFFER(gBattleTextBuff1, gBattleMons[attacker].type3);
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_AttackerBecameTheType);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Contact Moves Affected
All contact moves can trigger this ability, including but not limited to:
- Physical attacks like Tackle, Quick Attack, Body Slam
- Multi-hit moves like Fury Attack, Double Kick
- Priority moves like Mach Punch, Bullet Punch
- Most Fighting-type moves (Brick Break, Close Combat, etc.)
- Biting moves (Bite, Crunch, Fire Fang, etc.)

### Type Interactions After Activation
When an attacker gains Psychic typing:
- **Weak to**: Dark (2x), Bug (2x), Ghost (2x)
- **Resistant to**: Fighting (0.5x), Psychic (0.5x)
- **Immune to**: None

### Strategic Implications
**Defensive Usage**:
- Punishes physical attackers by making them vulnerable to Dark-type moves
- Particularly effective against Fighting-type Pokemon, making them resist their own moves
- Can disrupt opponent's strategy by changing their type matchups mid-battle

**Offensive Implications for Opponent**:
- Gained Psychic typing may help against Fighting-types
- New weaknesses to Dark, Bug, and Ghost types
- Must be considered when switching in teammates

### Common Users
Based on the proto data, Pokemon with Magical Dust include:
- Various moth and butterfly Pokemon (as innate ability)
- Psychic/Fairy-type Pokemon with mystical themes
- Generally appears on Pokemon with magical or dust-related themes

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Utility**: Strong defensive ability that can change type matchups
- **Timing**: Best used against physical attackers early in battle
- **Team Synergy**: Pairs well with Dark-type teammates who can exploit the new weakness
- **Counter-Strategy**: Opponents should prioritize special moves or already-Psychic attackers

### Counters
- **Special Moves**: Non-contact moves bypass the ability entirely
- **Psychic-types**: Already Psychic-type attackers are unaffected
- **Long-range Moves**: Moves like Earthquake, Surf, Flamethrower don't make contact
- **Status Moves**: Most status moves don't trigger the ability

### Synergies
- **Dark-type Teammates**: Can immediately exploit the new Psychic typing
- **Ghost-type Moves**: Become super effective against converted attackers  
- **Bug-type Coverage**: Gains effectiveness against converted Pokemon
- **Intimidate/Burn Support**: Helps reduce physical damage before conversion

### Version History
- Added in Elite Redux as part of the expanded ability roster
- ID 304 in the ability list
- Uses the enhanced typing system allowing for 3 simultaneous types

### Example Battle Scenario
1. Opponent's Machamp uses Close Combat on Magical Dust user
2. Machamp gains Psychic typing (becomes Fighting/Psychic)
3. Machamp is now weak to Dark moves (2x damage)
4. Machamp's own Fighting moves are now resisted by its Psychic typing
5. Partner Dark-type can switch in and exploit the new weakness

This ability represents a unique defensive mechanism that can significantly alter battle dynamics by permanently changing an opponent's typing and creating new strategic opportunities.
