## In-Game Description
Doubles Speed after consuming held item.

## Extended In-Game Description

When consuming or losing a held item, the user's base Speed stat is multiplied by x2. Boost goes away when switching out, gaining a new item, or upon losing the ability. Doubles all beneficial berry effects.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Sugar Rush doubles the Pokemon's Speed stat after consuming its held item. When a held item is used up or removed, the ability activates and provides a 2x Speed boost for the rest of the battle. This makes it perfect for setup strategies using consumable items.
