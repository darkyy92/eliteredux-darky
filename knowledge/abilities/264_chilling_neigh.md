# Chilling Neigh - Ability ID 264

## In-Game Description
"KOs raise Attack by one stage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When this Pokemon knocks out an opponent with a direct attack, its Attack stat increases by one stage. This boost applies immediately after the target faints and stacks with other Attack modifiers. The ability only triggers from moves that directly cause damage.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Chilling Neigh is a signature ability that triggers whenever the Pokemon with this ability defeats an opponent through direct attack damage. Here are the complete mechanics:

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger Condition**: Must directly knock out an opponent with an attacking move
- **Effect**: Raises the user's Attack stat by one stage (+50% Attack)
- **Timing**: Activates immediately after the target faints
- **Stacking**: Multiple KOs provide multiple Attack boosts (up to +6 stages maximum)

### Implementation Details
- Uses the same core function as Moxie but targets Attack stat specifically (STAT_ATK = 1)
- Implemented via `MoxieClone(battler, STAT_ATK)` function
- Requires `HasAttackerFaintedTarget()` check to verify the KO was from this Pokemon's attack
- Uses `ChangeStatBuffs()` with MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER flag

### Important Interactions
- **As One (Ice Rider)**: Combines this ability with Unnerve - both effects activate simultaneously
- **Crowned King**: Combines this with Unnerve and Grim Neigh for both Attack and Special Attack boosts
- **Status Moves**: Does NOT activate from indirect damage (poison, burn, etc.)
- **Substitute/Endure**: Does NOT activate if the target survives with 1 HP
- **Multi-hit Moves**: Only needs the final hit to cause the KO

### Comparison with Related Abilities
- **Moxie**: Identical mechanics, but Chilling Neigh is typically associated with Ice-type legendary Pokemon
- **Grim Neigh**: Sister ability that raises Special Attack instead of Attack
- **Beast Boost**: Raises the highest stat instead of specifically Attack

### Competitive Applications
- Excellent for physical sweepers that can secure KOs
- Particularly powerful in formats with weaker defensive Pokemon
- Pairs well with Choice items or Life Orb for initial KO power
- Strong in late-game cleanup scenarios
