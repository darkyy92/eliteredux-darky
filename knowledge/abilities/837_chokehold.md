# Chokehold - Ability ID 837

## In-Game Description
"Binding moves lower speed and paralyze."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Chokehold enhances binding moves like Wrap, Bind, and Fire Spin by adding paralysis and speed reduction effects. When this Pokemon uses a binding move, the trapped target becomes paralyzed and has its Speed stat lowered. The binding damage and trap duration remain unchanged from normal.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
- **Trigger**: When the Pokemon uses a binding move (Wrap, Bind, Fire Spin, Whirlpool, Sand Tomb, Clamp, Magma Storm, Infestation, etc.)
- **Primary Effect**: Inflicts paralysis status on the trapped target
- **Secondary Effect**: Lowers the trapped target's Speed stat
- **Binding Mechanics**: Standard binding damage (1/8 of max HP per turn) and duration (4-5 turns, or 7 with Grip Claw) remain unchanged

## Synergies and Strategy
- **Binding Moves**: Works with all moves that trap the opponent
- **Speed Control**: Combines trapping with speed reduction for setup opportunities
- **Status Spreading**: Guarantees paralysis without accuracy checks
- **Trap Teams**: Excellent for teams built around trapping strategies

## Pokemon with This Ability
- Species with Chokehold as a changeable ability
- Often found on Pokemon with trapping themes or constricting designs

## Notes
- The "(N)" in the ability name likely indicates it's a new or non-standard ability
- Paralysis prevents the opponent from switching out naturally, making the trap even more effective
- Speed reduction stacks with paralysis's inherent speed penalty
