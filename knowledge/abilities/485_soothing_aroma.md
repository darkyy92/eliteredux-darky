# Soothing Aroma - Ability ID 485

## In-Game Description
"Entry heals all party status if any exists."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

On entry, if any Pokemon in the user's party has a status condition (sleep, poison, burn, freeze, paralysis, toxic, frostbite, or bleed), this ability automatically heals all status conditions from every Pokemon in the user's party, including both active and benched Pokemon.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Soothing Aroma provides automatic team-wide status healing upon entry, but only activates when status conditions are actually present in the party.

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Activates when entering battle
- **Requirement**: At least one party member must have a status condition
- **Scope**: Heals ALL status conditions from ALL 6 party Pokemon
- **Detection**: Checks for any STATUS1_ANY condition in the party
- **Efficiency**: Only activates when healing is actually needed

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability SoothingAroma = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        // Check if any party member has status conditions
        for (u8 i = 0; i < PARTY_SIZE; i++) {
            if (GetMonData(&gPlayerParty[GET_BATTLER_SIDE(battler)][i], MON_DATA_STATUS) & STATUS1_ANY) {
                BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_EffectSoothingAroma);
                return TRUE;
            }
        }
        return FALSE;
    },
};
```

### Status Conditions Healed
**All major status conditions:**
- Sleep (including sleep counters)
- Poison (regular and badly poisoned)
- Burn (damage and attack reduction)
- Freeze (immobilization)
- Paralysis (speed reduction and move failure)
- Toxic (increasing poison damage)
- Frostbite (special attack reduction)
- Bleed (HP loss over time)

**Additional effects:**
- Nightmare status removal from active battlers
- Complete status restoration for entire party

### Strategic Applications
- **Status absorber**: Switch in after status moves to heal team
- **Aromatherapy alternative**: Provides team healing without move slot
- **Emergency healing**: Instant status cure when needed most
- **Pivot utility**: Safe switching with team support benefit
- **Anti-status teams**: Hard counter to status-heavy strategies

### Comparison to Similar Effects
**vs Aromatherapy move:**
- Automatic activation vs manual use
- Entry timing vs turn investment
- Conditional activation vs guaranteed use
- No PP limitation vs 5 PP

**vs Natural Cure:**
- Team healing vs self-only
- Entry activation vs switch-out timing
- All party members vs single Pokemon

**vs Heal Bell:**
- No Soundproof immunity vs blocked by Soundproof
- Entry effect vs move usage
- Conditional vs guaranteed activation

### Team Synergy
**Excellent with:**
- Status-weak teammates: Protects valuable team members
- Pivot strategies: Enhanced switching value
- Stall teams: Removes status pressure from defensive core
- Setup sweepers: Clears status before critical setup turns
- Choice users: Removes status without switching items

### Battle Scenarios
**Early game activation:**
- Opponent uses Toxic Spikes
- Switch in Soothing Aroma user
- Entire team cured of poison
- Immediate battlefield advantage

**Mid-battle support:**
- Key Pokemon gets burned/paralyzed
- Switch to Soothing Aroma user
- Status removed from entire team
- Tactical reset without turn loss

### Limitations
- **Conditional activation**: No effect if team is healthy
- **One-time per switch**: Only triggers once per entry
- **Entry requirement**: Must actually switch in to activate
- **No prevention**: Doesn't prevent future status conditions
- **Timing dependency**: Must switch at right moment

### Counters
- **Immediate re-status**: Apply status again after healing
- **Multi-turn pressure**: Continuous status application
- **Non-status strategies**: Physical/special damage focus
- **Trap moves**: Prevent switching to activate ability
- **Speed pressure**: KO before switch opportunity

### Competitive Usage
- **Support role**: Primary function as team status cleanser
- **Defensive pivots**: Enhanced switching utility
- **Anti-meta**: Counters status-heavy team compositions
- **Emergency response**: Clutch healing in critical moments
- **Team insurance**: Safety net against status pressure

### Double Battle Applications
- **Partner protection**: Heals ally Pokemon immediately
- **Field presence**: Team-wide benefit upon entry
- **Coordination**: Enables status-weak strategies
- **Support utility**: Primary team support function

### Item Synergies
- **Leftovers**: Sustain while providing team support
- **Mental Herb**: Additional status protection
- **Chople Berry**: Survive to provide healing
- **Rocky Helmet**: Punish contact while healing team

### Move Synergies
- **U-turn/Volt Switch**: Pivot out after healing team
- **Protect**: Stall while team benefits from healing
- **Recovery moves**: Personal sustain + team status healing
- **Status moves**: Apply pressure after clearing team status

### Usage Patterns
**Reactive switching:**
- Monitor team status conditions
- Switch when healing provides maximum value
- Coordinate with team needs

**Proactive positioning:**
- Anticipate status moves
- Position for optimal switch timing
- Maximize team benefit
