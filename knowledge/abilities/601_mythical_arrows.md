# Mythical Arrows - Ability ID 601

## In-Game Description
"Arrow moves become special and deal 30% more damage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Arrow moves become special and deal 30% more damage. Affects all 18 arrow moves with diverse types and effects (burn, poison, paralysis, leech seed). Allows physical attackers to deal special damage using Special Attack stat. Perfect for Aegislash Redux's high Special Attack of 140 (200 as Mega).

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**MYTHICAL ARROWS** is a move conversion ability that transforms physical arrow-based moves into special attacks while providing a substantial damage boost.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Damage Multiplier**: 1.3x (30% boost) to all arrow-based moves
- **Move Conversion**: Changes physical arrow moves to special category
- **Stat Usage**: Converted moves use Special Attack and target Special Defense
- **Effect Retention**: All secondary effects of arrow moves are preserved

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability MythicalArrows = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = Archer.onOffensiveMultiplier,  // 1.3x multiplier
    .onSwapSplit = +[](ON_SWAP_SPLIT) -> int {
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].split == SPLIT_PHYSICAL)
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].arrowBased);
        return TRUE;  // Converts to special
    },
};
```
