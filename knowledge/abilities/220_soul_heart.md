## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Soul-Heart raises Special Attack by one stage when any Pokémon faints on the battlefield, including allies and enemies. Triggers regardless of who caused the KO. The stat boost stacks with other increases and persists through switches, making it powerful for late-game sweeping scenarios.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Soul-Heart is a powerful stat-boosting ability that activates whenever any Pokémon faints during battle, regardless of the cause or perpetrator of the KO.

**Key Implementation Details:**
```cpp
constexpr Ability SoulHeart = {
    .onBattlerFaints = +[](ON_BATTLER_FAINTS) -> int {
        CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, STAT_SPATK, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER | STAT_BUFF_DONT_SET_BUFFERS, NULL))
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_RaiseStatOnFaintingTarget);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ANY,
};
```

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Any Pokémon fainting on the battlefield
- **Scope**: Applies to ANY battler fainting (`APPLY_ON_ANY`)
  - Allied Pokémon fainting
  - Enemy Pokémon fainting
  - The Soul-Heart user itself fainting (though this is rarely relevant)
- **Cause Independence**: Doesn't matter how the KO occurred:
  - Direct damage from moves
  - Status condition damage (poison, burn, etc.)
  - Recoil damage
  - Entry hazard damage
  - Weather damage
  - Self-KO moves like Explosion

### Numerical Values
- **Stat Boost**: +1 stage to Special Attack per activation
- **Stage Multiplier**: Each +1 stage = 1.5x Special Attack
- **Maximum**: Can stack up to +6 stages (4x Special Attack total)
- **Persistence**: Boosts remain through switches and do not reset

### Technical Implementation
The ability uses the `onBattlerFaints` hook with `APPLY_ON_ANY` scope, meaning it triggers for any battler that faints. The stat boost is applied using `ChangeStatBuffs` with a +1 modifier to `STAT_SPATK`.

### Strategic Implications
**Offensive Potential:**
- Excellent for late-game scenarios where multiple KOs have occurred
- Synergizes well with sacrifice strategies using allies
- Can quickly reach maximum Special Attack boosts in chaotic battles

**Defensive Considerations:**
- Opponents may avoid KOing allies to deny Soul-Heart boosts
- Can turn unfavorable trades into advantageous stat gains
- Particularly dangerous in multi-battle formats or long battles

### Example Scenarios
**Scenario 1 - Allied Sacrifice:**
Turn 1: Ally uses Explosion, faints → Soul-Heart user gains +1 Sp. Atk
Turn 2: Soul-Heart user sweeps with boosted attacks

**Scenario 2 - Chain KOs:**
Multiple Pokémon faint in succession due to status/hazards → Multiple Sp. Atk boosts stack

### Common Users
Notable Pokémon with Soul-Heart in Elite Redux:
- **Magearna** (primary/innate ability)
- **Wigglytuff Apex** (innate ability)
- **Gardevoir Mega** (innate ability)  
- **Xerneas/Xerneas Active** (innate ability)
- **Various Psychic/Fairy-type specialists** (changeable ability)

### Competitive Usage Notes
**Strengths:**
- Passive stat boosting requiring no setup moves
- Triggers off opponent's actions as well as allies
- Stacks indefinitely up to +6 stages
- Cannot be prevented by Taunt or similar effects

**Weaknesses:**
- Relies on KOs occurring to activate
- Useless if no Pokémon faint during battle
- Stat boosts can be reset by moves like Haze or Clear Smog
- Doesn't provide immediate benefit upon switching in

### Counters
- **Haze/Clear Smog**: Reset all stat changes
- **Roar/Whirlwind**: Force switches to waste accumulated boosts
- **Critical hits**: Ignore stat boosts when calculating damage
- **Unaware**: Ignore stat boosts when taking damage

### Synergies
**Complementary Abilities:**
- **Magic Guard** (innate): Prevents indirect damage, ensuring survival to use boosts
- **Serene Grace** (innate): Doubles secondary effect chances on boosted attacks
- **Pixilate**: Converts Normal moves to Fairy with power boost

**Team Strategies:**
- Pairs well with Explosion/Self-Destruct users
- Benefits from entry hazard stacking to cause more faints
- Effective with status spreaders causing gradual KOs

### Version History
Soul-Heart was introduced in Generation VII as Magearna's signature ability. In Elite Redux, it has been distributed to various Pokémon as both a changeable and innate ability, making it more accessible for strategic team building while maintaining its powerful late-game potential.
