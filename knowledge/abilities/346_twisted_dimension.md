# Twisted Dimension - Ability ID 346

## In-Game Description
"Automatically sets up Trick Room for 3 turns upon entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Upon entering battle, automatically sets up Trick Room for 3 turns, reversing move order so slower Pokemon move first. This instant battlefield control eliminates setup time and transforms bulky Pokemon into immediate offensive threats. The short duration demands careful timing to maximize impact.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Basic Information
- **Ability ID:** 346  
- **Type:** Field Effect Entry Ability  
- **Generation:** Elite Redux

### Overview

Twisted Dimension is a powerful entry ability that automatically sets up Trick Room upon switching in, lasting for 3 turns instead of the standard 5. This ability transforms slow, bulky Pokemon into immediate offensive threats by reversing speed priority on the battlefield.

## Mechanics

### Core Implementation
- **File Location:** `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (Lines 3657-3667)
- **Activation:** Triggers on entry (onEntry hook)
- **Duration:** 3 turns (`TRICK_ROOM_DURATION_SHORT`)
- **Condition Check:** Only activates if Trick Room is not already active

### Technical Details

```cpp
constexpr Ability TwistedDimension = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(gFieldStatuses & STATUS_FIELD_TRICK_ROOM)
        
        gFieldTimers.started.trickRoom = TRUE;
        gFieldStatuses |= STATUS_FIELD_TRICK_ROOM;
        gFieldTimers.trickRoomTimer = TRICK_ROOM_DURATION_SHORT;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_TwistedDimensionActivated);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Battle Message
- **Message:** "{POKÃ‰MON}'s Twisted Dimension set up Trick Room!"
- **Animation:** Uses Trick Room move animation
- **String ID:** `STRINGID_TWISTEDDIMENSIONACTIVATED` (624)

## Strategic Applications

### Immediate Offensive Pressure
- Transforms traditionally slow Pokemon into speed demons
- Eliminates setup time typically required for Trick Room
- Creates instant offensive presence upon switching in

### Team Composition Synergy
- Essential for Trick Room teams in Elite Redux
- Pairs excellently with slow, powerful attackers
- Supports bulky sweepers and wallbreakers

### Tactical Advantages
1. **Surprise Factor:** Opponents may not expect immediate Trick Room
2. **Action Economy:** Saves a turn compared to using Trick Room move
3. **Guaranteed Setup:** Cannot be prevented by Taunt or Mental Herb

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- **Automatic Setup:** No turn wasted on setup moves
- **Immediate Impact:** Instant battlefield control
- **Reliable Activation:** Always triggers on entry (unless TR already active)

### Limitations
- **Shortened Duration:** Only 3 turns vs. standard 5 turns
- **One-Time Use:** Cannot reactivate if Pokemon remains in battle
- **Predictable:** Opponents can prepare for Trick Room conditions

### Counterplay Options
1. **Speed Control:** Use your own Trick Room or speed manipulation
2. **Switching:** Bring in faster Pokemon to revenge kill
3. **Stall:** Wait out the 3-turn duration
4. **Priority Moves:** Bypass speed reversal entirely
