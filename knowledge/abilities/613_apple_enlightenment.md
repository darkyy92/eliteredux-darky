# Apple Enlightenment - Ability ID 613

## In-Game Description
"Combines Fur Coat and Magic Guard for dual defensive protection."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Apple Enlightenment combines Fur Coat and Magic Guard. Physical attacks deal half damage while indirect damage from poison, burn, weather, hazards, and recoil is blocked. Only direct moves can harm the user. Excellent bulk vs physical attacks and passive damage but vulnerable to special moves.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Apple Enlightenment is a defensive ability that combines two powerful protective effects, making the user extremely resilient to both physical attacks and indirect damage sources.

### Core Mechanics
- **Fur Coat Effect**: Physical attacks deal 50% damage (0.5x multiplier)
- **Magic Guard Effect**: Complete immunity to indirect damage sources
- **Dual Protection**: Both effects work simultaneously
- **Special Attack Vulnerability**: No protection against special moves

### Protected Damage Sources (Magic Guard)
- Poison and burn damage
- Weather damage (sandstorm, hail)
- Entry hazards (Stealth Rock, Spikes)
- Recoil damage from moves
- Life Orb damage
- Rough Skin/Iron Barbs damage

### Strategic Applications
- **Physical Wall**: Extreme bulk against physical attackers
- **Hazard Immunity**: Safe switching with no hazard concerns
- **Status Immunity**: Poison and burn become harmless
- **Recoil Moves**: Can use Life Orb and recoil moves without penalty
- **Weather Independence**: Unaffected by damaging weather

### Notable Interactions
- **Choice Items**: No Life Orb damage makes Choice items relatively better
- **Substitute**: Can use Substitute without HP cost concerns
- **Setup Potential**: Physical bulk allows setup opportunities
- **Special Vulnerability**: Must respect special attackers
