# Tangled Feet - Ability ID 77

## In-Game Description
"Doubles Evasion when confused."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (exactly 280-300 chars)*

Tangled Feet halves opponents' accuracy when this Pokemon is confused. The chaotic, unsteady movements from confusion make the Pokemon harder to hit. Works against all moves targeting this Pokemon, including status moves. Only functions while confused; provides no benefit otherwise.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**TANGLED FEET** is a defensive ability that reduces incoming accuracy while the user is confused.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: Only when this Pokemon has the confused status (STATUS2_CONFUSION)
- **Effect**: Halves the accuracy of moves targeting this Pokemon (*accuracy /= 2)
- **Application**: Applied during accuracy calculation phase with ACCURACY_MULTIPLICATIVE priority
- **Target Requirement**: Uses onAccuracyFor = APPLY_ON_TARGET (affects moves targeting this Pokemon)

### Activation Conditions:
1. **Status Check**: Pokemon must have STATUS2_CONFUSION bit set
2. **Target Validation**: Only applies when this Pokemon is the target of a move
3. **Move Coverage**: Affects all moves (attacking, status, etc.) that target this Pokemon
4. **Duration**: Active for entire duration of confusion status

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability TangledFeet = {
    .onAccuracy = +[](ON_ACCURACY) -> AccuracyPriority {
        CHECK(gBattleMons[target].status2 & STATUS2_CONFUSION);
        *accuracy /= 2;
        return ACCURACY_MULTIPLICATIVE;
    },
    .onAccuracyFor = APPLY_ON_TARGET,
    .breakable = TRUE,
};
```

### Numerical Values:
- **Accuracy Modifier**: 0.5x (50% of original accuracy)
- **Examples**:
  - Thunder Bolt (100% accuracy) to 50% accuracy
  - Thunder (70% accuracy) to 35% accuracy
  - Fire Blast (85% accuracy) to 42.5% accuracy
  - Focus Blast (70% accuracy) to 35% accuracy

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics:
1. **Ability Interactions**:
   - Overridden by **No Guard** (both user and opponent)
   - Stacks with **Sand Veil/Snow Cloak** evasion boosts
   - Works alongside **Wonder Skin** for status moves
   - Bypassed by **Keen Eye** users attacking this Pokemon

2. **Move Interactions**:
   - Affects **never-miss moves** like Swift and Aerial Ace (they still hit)
   - Reduces accuracy of **OHKO moves** (already low accuracy)
   - Applies to **status moves** targeting this Pokemon
   - Stacks multiplicatively with accuracy drops from moves like Sand Attack

3. **Status Synergy**:
   - **Own Tempo** prevents confusion, negating this ability
   - **Lum Berry/Mental Herb** cure confusion, ending the effect
   - Confusion from **Swagger** activates this ability
   - **Persim Berry** cures confusion after eating

### Strategic Implications:
1. **Defensive Strategy**:
   - Intentionally getting confused can provide evasion
   - Pairs well with Swagger users for setup
   - Creates mind games around confusion curing

2. **Risk vs Reward**:
   - Confusion deals self-damage 33% of the time
   - 50% accuracy reduction vs 33% self-harm chance
   - Becomes less effective as battle progresses due to confusion timer

3. **Team Support**:
   - Teammates can use Swagger to activate ability
   - Heal Bell/Aromatherapy can remove confusion when needed
   - Trick/Switcheroo with Persim Berry for timing control

### Common Users:
- **Original Games**: Spinda (signature ability), Doduo/Dodrio line
- **Elite Redux**: Currently appears in commented trainer parties but not actively used
- **AI Evaluation**: Rated 2/10 by battle AI (low priority ability)

### Competitive Usage Notes:
1. **Niche Applications**:
   - Anti-revenge kill tool (confusion + evasion)
   - Stall tactics in specific matchups
   - Surprise factor in casual play

2. **Limitations**:
   - Requires negative status to function
   - Confusion timer limits duration
   - Many Pokemon have access to never-miss moves
   - Self-damage risk often outweighs benefits

### Counters:
1. **Direct Counters**:
   - **No Guard** ability ignores accuracy modifiers
   - **Keen Eye** prevents accuracy reduction (when attacking)
   - Never-miss moves (Swift, Aerial Ace, etc.)
   - **Lock-On/Mind Reader** guarantees next move hits

2. **Indirect Counters**:
   - Status cleansing moves (Heal Bell, Aromatherapy)
   - Phazing moves (Roar, Whirlwind) to force switches
   - Multi-hit moves (more chances to hit)
   - Priority moves for guaranteed damage

### Synergies:
1. **Team Support**:
   - **Swagger** users to intentionally confuse
   - **Prankster** status spreaders
   - **Aromatic Veil** teammates for confusion immunity backup

2. **Item Synergies**:
   - **Leftovers** to offset confusion damage
   - **Mental Herb** for emergency confusion cure
   - **Persim Berry** for automatic confusion removal

3. **Move Synergies**:
   - **Rest** can cure confusion while healing
   - **Substitute** protects from confusion damage
   - **Facade** benefits from confusion status

### Version History:
- **Gen 4**: Introduced as Spinda's signature ability
- **Gen 5+**: Also given to Doduo/Dodrio line
- **Elite Redux**: Standard implementation, currently unused in active trainer parties

### Notes:
- One of the few abilities that requires a negative status to function
- The ability is breakable by Mold Breaker and similar effects
- Despite its unique concept, rarely sees competitive play due to inherent risks
- More effective against physical attackers due to confusion's physical damage component
