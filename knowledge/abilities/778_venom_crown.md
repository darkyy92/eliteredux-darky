# Venom Crown - Ability ID 778

## In-Game Description
"Poison Point + Mighty Horn."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Has a 30% chance to inflict poison on contact moves, both when attacking and being attacked. Boosts the power of horn and drill-based attacks by 30%.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Venom Crown is a dual-effect ability that combines the effects of Poison Point and Mighty Horn:

### Poison Point Component
- When the user is hit by a contact move, there is a 30% chance to inflict poison on the attacker
- Only triggers if the attacker can be poisoned (not Poison-type, Steel-type, or has poison immunity)
- The poison status inflicts 1/8 HP damage per turn
- Does not activate if the user faints from the contact move

### Mighty Horn Component  
- Provides a 1.3x damage multiplier (30% boost) to all horn-based moves
- Horn-based moves include: Horn Attack, Fury Attack, Horn Drill, Megahorn, Horn Leech, Jagged Horns, Smart Strike, Drill Run, Hyper Drill, and many others
- The boost applies to both physical and special horn-based moves
- Stacks multiplicatively with other damage boosts

### Additional Properties
- This ability is banned from the randomizer (`randomizerBanned = TRUE`)
- Currently appears as an innate ability on Mega Nidoking alongside Kings Wrath and Fearmonger
- The combination makes Mega Nidoking extremely dangerous in close combat, as it can both punish contact moves and deal massive damage with horn attacks

### Strategic Applications
- Excellent for Pokemon that learn both horn-based moves and benefit from contact move punishment
- Creates a risk-reward scenario where opponents must choose between using contact moves (risking poison) or non-contact moves (often weaker)
- The horn boost synergizes well with high Attack stats, making physical horn moves particularly devastating
- Works well in doubles/triples where the user can be positioned to take hits while dealing enhanced horn damage

This ability represents the pinnacle of offensive poison types, combining defensive utility with significant offensive enhancement.
