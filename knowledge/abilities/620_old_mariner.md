## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Combines Seaweed and Amphibious effects. Grants Water-type STAB to all moves and immunity to drench status. Grass moves deal 2x damage to Fire types while Fire moves deal 0.5x damage to Grass types. An effective maritime battler with botanical advantages against specific matchups.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Old Mariner is a compound ability that combines maritime expertise with botanical knowledge, providing both Water-type benefits and enhanced type effectiveness manipulation.

### Core Mechanics
- **Amphibious Effect**: All moves gain Water-type STAB (1.5x damage)
- **Drench Immunity**: Complete immunity to drench status effect
- **Type Effectiveness Override**: Modifies Grass vs Fire interactions
- **Dual Benefits**: Both Seaweed and Amphibious effects apply simultaneously

### Type Effectiveness Changes
- **Grass vs Fire**: Grass moves deal 2x damage to Fire types (instead of 0.5x)
- **Fire vs Grass**: Fire moves deal 0.5x damage to Grass types (instead of 2x)
- **Water STAB**: All moves treated as Water-type for STAB purposes

### Strategic Applications
- **Universal STAB**: Every move benefits from Water-type same-type attack bonus
- **Type Advantage Reversal**: Grass moves become super effective against Fire types
- **Status Immunity**: Cannot be affected by drench status
- **Versatile Coverage**: Provides Water STAB while maintaining original move types

### Notable Interactions
- **Move Diversity**: Non-Water moves still benefit from Water STAB
- **Defensive Utility**: Fire moves become less threatening to Grass types
- **Offensive Power**: Grass moves gain significant power against Fire opponents
- **Status Protection**: Drench immunity provides additional defensive value
