## Extended In-Game Description

If user is Grass-type, they take half damage from Fire-type attacks and deals 2x damage to Fire-type Pokemon with Grass-type moves. Multiplicative with other sources of damage reduction. Grants STAB to Water-type moves regardless of the user's typing. Also provides immunity to being drenched.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Old Mariner is a compound ability that combines maritime expertise with botanical knowledge, providing both Water-type benefits and enhanced type effectiveness manipulation.

### Core Mechanics
- **Amphibious Effect**: All moves gain Water-type STAB (1.5x damage)
- **Drench Immunity**: Complete immunity to drench status effect
- **Type Effectiveness Override**: Modifies Grass vs Fire interactions
- **Dual Benefits**: Both Seaweed and Amphibious effects apply simultaneously

### Type Effectiveness Changes
- **Grass vs Fire**: Grass moves deal 2x damage to Fire types (instead of 0.5x)
- **Fire vs Grass**: Fire moves deal 0.5x damage to Grass types (instead of 2x)
- **Water STAB**: All moves treated as Water-type for STAB purposes

### Strategic Applications
- **Universal STAB**: Every move benefits from Water-type same-type attack bonus
- **Type Advantage Reversal**: Grass moves become super effective against Fire types
- **Status Immunity**: Cannot be affected by drench status
- **Versatile Coverage**: Provides Water STAB while maintaining original move types

### Notable Interactions
- **Move Diversity**: Non-Water moves still benefit from Water STAB
- **Defensive Utility**: Fire moves become less threatening to Grass types
- **Offensive Power**: Grass moves gain significant power against Fire opponents
- **Status Protection**: Drench immunity provides additional defensive value
