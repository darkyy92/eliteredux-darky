# Feline Prowess - Ability ID 301

## In-Game Description
"Doubles own Sp. Atk stat. Boosts raw stat, not base stat."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Feline Prowess doubles the Pokémon's Special Attack stat by applying a 2x multiplier to all special attack calculations. This affects the raw calculated stat rather than the base stat, meaning it stacks multiplicatively with stat boosts and items. The effect is permanent and active from battle entry.

*Character count: 293*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Effect**: Doubles the Pokémon's Special Attack stat (2x multiplier)
- **Application**: Applied to the raw calculated stat, not the base stat
- **Timing**: Active immediately upon entering battle
- **Stacking**: Multiplicative with stat boosts, items, and other modifiers

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability FelineProwess = {
    .onStat =
        +[](ON_STAT) {
            if (statId == STAT_SPATK) *stat *= 2;
        },
};
```

The ability hooks into the stat calculation system and applies a 2x multiplier whenever the Special Attack stat is calculated.

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Automatic when Special Attack stat is calculated
- **Requirements**: None - always active
- **Duration**: Permanent while the Pokémon is in battle
- **Scope**: Affects all special moves and stat calculations

### Numerical Values
- **Multiplier**: 2.0x (100% increase)
- **Example**: A Pokémon with 100 base Special Attack becomes effectively 200
- **With +1 boost**: 100 → 200 (Feline Prowess) → 300 (with +1 boost) = 3x total
- **With Choice Specs**: 100 → 200 (Feline Prowess) → 300 (with Choice Specs) = 3x total

### Stat Calculation Order
1. Base stat + EVs + IVs + nature = base calculated stat
2. Feline Prowess multiplies by 2.0x
3. Stat boosts (+/-6 stages) apply multiplicatively
4. Items like Choice Specs apply multiplicatively
5. Abilities like Hustle apply multiplicatively

### Common Users
- **Espeon Galaxy**: Primary forme with this as a regular ability (all 3 slots)
- **Meowth Partner Mega**: Has as an innate ability alongside other abilities
- **Various Cat-like Pokémon**: Given thematically to feline Pokémon

### Strategic Implications
- **Immediate Power**: Instant 2x Special Attack boost without setup
- **No Drawbacks**: Unlike abilities like Hustle, has no negative side effects
- **Stacking Potential**: Combines multiplicatively with stat boosts and items
- **Special Sweeping**: Ideal for special attackers that need immediate power
- **Choice Item Synergy**: Particularly powerful with Choice Specs for 3x total boost

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Tier Impact**: Significantly raises the power level of any special attacker
- **Speed Control**: Often paired with speed control since raw power is guaranteed
- **Coverage Moves**: Makes even low base power coverage moves threatening
- **Entry Hazard Weakness**: No defensive benefits, so entry hazard support helpful
- **Priority Weakness**: Vulnerable to priority moves due to no defensive boost

### Counters and Weaknesses
- **Special Walls**: High Special Defense still walls effectively despite the boost
- **Priority Moves**: Physical priority moves bypass the special attack boost
- **Status Effects**: Burns don't affect special attacks, but paralysis/sleep still work
- **Abilities**: Abilities like Wonder Guard or Flash Fire can still provide immunities
- **Trick Room**: Speed control can limit effectiveness despite power boost

### Synergies
- **Choice Items**: Choice Specs for 3x total boost, Choice Scarf for speed + power
- **Stat Boosting**: Calm Mind, Nasty Plot stack multiplicatively
- **Weather**: Special attack boosting weather effects stack
- **Screens**: Light Screen on opponent's side doesn't reduce the base multiplier
- **Life Orb**: Stacks multiplicatively for even higher damage output

### Damage Calculation Examples
**Base Case**: 100 Special Attack Pokémon using 90 BP move
- Normal: ~45-53 damage vs neutral target
- With Feline Prowess: ~90-106 damage vs neutral target

**With Choice Specs**: 100 Special Attack + Feline Prowess + Choice Specs
- Total multiplier: 2.0x (Feline Prowess) × 1.5x (Choice Specs) = 3.0x
- Damage: ~135-159 vs neutral target

**With +1 Calm Mind**: 100 Special Attack + Feline Prowess + Calm Mind
- Total multiplier: 2.0x (Feline Prowess) × 1.5x (+1 boost) = 3.0x
- Damage: ~135-159 vs neutral target

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Introduced as ability ID 301
- **Current Status**: Active and implemented
- **Name Discrepancy**: Code refers to "Feline Prowess" while protobuf shows "Cryptic Power"

### Notes
- The ability name shows as "Cryptic Power" in the game data but is coded as "Feline Prowess"
- This may be a display name vs internal name difference
- Implementation is straightforward and reliable
- No known bugs or edge cases in current implementation
