# Way of Precision - Ability ID 679

## In-Game Description
Inner Focus + Precise Fist effects.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*
Way of Precision combines Inner Focus and Precise Fist into a devastating martial arts ability. This makes Focus Blast never miss while dramatically enhancing all punching moves through increased critical hit rates and amplified secondary effects that activate 5x more often than normal.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Effects

#### Inner Focus Component
- **Focus Blast Accuracy:** Focus Blast always hits when used by this Pokemon, bypassing the move's normally unreliable 70% accuracy
- **Taunt Immunity:** Cannot be affected by Taunt
- **Ability Breaking:** Can be suppressed by abilities like Mold Breaker

#### Precise Fist Component  
- **Critical Hit Boost:** All punching moves (moves with FLAG_IRON_FIST_BOOST) have +1 critical hit stage
- **Effect Amplification:** Secondary effects of punching moves are 5x more likely to activate
- **Affected Moves:** Comet Punch, Mega Punch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and other punch-based attacks

### Competitive Usage

Way of Precision creates a unique niche for Pokemon that can utilize both Focus Blast and punching moves effectively. The guaranteed accuracy on Focus Blast provides reliable Fighting-type coverage, while the critical hit boost and effect amplification make punching moves incredibly potent. This combination is particularly valuable on mixed attackers that can leverage both special and physical moves.

### Trivia

- One of the "Way of" series abilities that combine two existing abilities
- The critical hit boost applies specifically to punching moves, not all moves
- The 5x effect chance multiplier can make normally low-chance effects nearly guaranteed
