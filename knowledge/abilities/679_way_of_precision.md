# Way of Precision

**Type:** Combination Ability  
**ID:** 679  
**Introduced:** Elite Redux

## Description

Way of Precision combines the precision-focused benefits of Inner Focus and Precise Fist into a single devastating ability. This ability makes Focus Blast never miss while dramatically enhancing the effectiveness of punching moves through increased critical hit rates and amplified secondary effects.

## Effects

### Inner Focus Component
- **Focus Blast Accuracy:** Focus Blast always hits when used by this Pokémon, bypassing the move's normally unreliable 70% accuracy
- **Taunt Immunity:** Cannot be affected by Taunt
- **Ability Breaking:** Can be suppressed by abilities like Mold Breaker

### Precise Fist Component  
- **Critical Hit Boost:** All punching moves (moves with FLAG_IRON_FIST_BOOST) have +1 critical hit stage
- **Effect Amplification:** Secondary effects of punching moves are 5x more likely to activate
- **Affected Moves:** Comet Punch, Mega Punch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and other punch-based attacks

## Competitive Usage

Way of Precision creates a unique niche for Pokémon that can utilize both Focus Blast and punching moves effectively. The guaranteed accuracy on Focus Blast provides reliable Fighting-type coverage, while the critical hit boost and effect amplification make punching moves incredibly potent. This combination is particularly valuable on mixed attackers that can leverage both special and physical moves.

## Trivia

- One of the "Way of" series abilities that combine two existing abilities
- The critical hit boost applies specifically to punching moves, not all moves
- The 5x effect chance multiplier can make normally low-chance effects nearly guaranteed
