# Thermal Exchange - Ability ID 575

## In-Game Description
"Ups Attack when hit by Fire. Immune to burn."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Thermal Exchange boosts Attack by one stage when hit by Fire-type moves and grants complete immunity to burn status. The Attack boost applies immediately after taking damage from any Fire attack. Burn cannot be inflicted by moves, abilities, or items. Stacks with other stat boosts.

*Character count: 282*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Thermal Exchange provides two distinct defensive effects against Fire-type attacks:

1. **Attack Boost on Fire Damage**: When the Pokémon is hit by a Fire-type move that would deal damage, its Attack stat is raised by +1 stage immediately after damage calculation.

2. **Complete Burn Immunity**: The Pokémon cannot be inflicted with burn status through any means, including moves like Will-O-Wisp, abilities like Flame Body, or items like Flame Orb.

### Activation Conditions
- **Attack Boost**: Triggers on `onDefender` when:
  - `ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler)` is true (standard on-hit ability check)
  - `moveType == TYPE_FIRE` (move must be Fire-type)
  - `CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_ATK)` is true (Attack can still be raised)

- **Burn Immunity**: Triggers on `onStatusImmune` when:
  - `status & CHECK_BURN` is true (any burn status attempt)

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability ThermalExchange = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(moveType == TYPE_FIRE)
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_ATK))

        SetStatChanger(STAT_ATK, 1);
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_TargetAbilityStatRaiseOnMoveEnd);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_BURN)
        return TRUE;
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .removesStatusOnImmunity = TRUE,
};
```

### Affected Fire-Type Moves
All moves with `TYPE_FIRE` classification trigger the Attack boost, including but not limited to:
- Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Overheat
- Fire Punch, Blaze Kick, Flame Charge
- Heat Wave, Lava Plume, Eruption
- Hidden Power Fire, Tera Blast (when Fire-type)
- Fire-type Z-moves and Max Moves

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics

**Stat Stage Mechanics**:
- Each trigger raises Attack by exactly +1 stage (50% boost at +1, 100% at +2, etc.)
- Maximum Attack boost is +6 stages (+300% total)
- Stacks with other Attack-boosting effects (items, moves, abilities)
- Can be reset by moves like Clear Smog or abilities like Clear Body opponents

**Burn Immunity Details**:
- Prevents burn from direct status moves (Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave variants)
- Blocks burn from secondary effects (Scald 30% chance, Lava Plume, etc.)
- Stops burn from abilities (Flame Body, Flaming Jaws, etc.)
- Negates burn from held items (Flame Orb)
- `removesStatusOnImmunity = TRUE` means existing burns are cured upon gaining this ability

### Strategic Implications

**Offensive Pressure**:
- Turns Fire-type attacks into setup opportunities
- +1 Attack significantly improves physical damage output
- Multiple Fire hits can quickly max out Attack stat
- Particularly effective against Fire-type spam teams

**Fire-Type Matchup Reversal**:
- Completely reverses the typical Fire vs Steel/Ice dynamic
- Ice-types with this ability become Fire-type checks instead of victims
- Creates psychological pressure for Fire-type users

**Team Synergy**:
- Excellent on physical attackers that fear burn status
- Pairs well with moves that benefit from Attack boosts (physical STAB, coverage)
- Good on defensive pivots that can tank Fire moves and gain offensive presence

### Example Damage Calculations
Assuming base 100 Attack Pokémon with neutral nature:
- **Base**: 100 Attack = 236 final Attack stat at level 50
- **+1 Stage**: 150% = 354 Attack (50% increase)
- **+2 Stages**: 200% = 472 Attack (100% increase)
- **+6 Stages**: 400% = 944 Attack (300% increase, maximum)

### Common Users in Elite Redux
Based on proto data analysis:
- Various Ice-type Pokémon (creating Fire/Ice type interactions)
- Steel-types that benefit from Fire resistance and Attack boosts
- Physical attackers that want burn immunity
- Defensive Pokémon that can pivot and gain offensive presence

### Competitive Usage Notes

**Strengths**:
- Excellent Fire-type deterrent
- Provides both offensive and defensive utility
- No drawbacks or negative effects
- Reliable activation conditions

**Counters**:
- Special Fire-type moves still boost Attack but don't rely on Attack stat
- Non-Fire status moves (Thunder Wave, Toxic, Sleep Powder)
- Stat-clearing moves (Clear Smog, Haze)
- Abilities that prevent stat boosts (Clear Body on opponents)

**Synergies**:
- Physical STAB moves to utilize Attack boosts
- Priority moves for immediate pressure after boost
- Protective moves to avoid other status conditions
- Entry hazard support to wear down Fire-types switching in

### Version History
- Added in Elite Redux as ability ID 575
