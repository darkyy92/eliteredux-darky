# Grass Flute

Grass Flute transforms the user's sound-based moves into fear-inducing melodies. When this Pokemon uses any sound move (like Hyper Voice, Boomburst, or Sing), it has a chance to inflict the Fear status on the target. Feared Pokemon cannot switch out and take 1.5x damage from all attacks.
