# Grass Flute - Ability ID 831

## In-Game Description
Sound moves inflict Fear status.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Sound moves inflict Fear on hit. Fear traps the target for 2 turns and they take 50% more damage. If forced out by moves like Whirlwind, the target loses Fear.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Grass Flute transforms the user's sound-based moves into fear-inducing melodies. When this Pokemon uses any sound move (like Hyper Voice, Boomburst, or Sing), it has a chance to inflict the Fear status on the target. Feared Pokemon cannot switch out and take 1.5x damage from all attacks.
