# Corrosion - Ability ID 212

## In-Game Description
"Poison is super effective vs Steel. Can poison any type."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Poison-type moves become super effective against Steel-type Pokemon (2x damage instead of 0.5x). Additionally, this Pokemon can inflict poison status on any type, including Steel and Poison types that are normally immune. Useful for breaking through traditional poison immunities.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Corrosion provides two distinct mechanical effects that break traditional poison immunity rules:

### Type Effectiveness Modification
- **Core Mechanic**: Poison-type moves deal super effective (2x) damage to Steel-type Pokemon
- **Normal Interaction**: Steel resists Poison (0.5x damage)
- **With Corrosion**: Steel takes super effective damage from Poison (2x damage)
- **Implementation**: Uses `onTypeEffectiveness` hook to modify damage multiplier from 0.5x to 2.0x

```cpp
.onTypeEffectiveness = +[](ON_TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS) -> int {
    CHECK(moveType == TYPE_POISON)
    CHECK(defType == TYPE_STEEL)
    *mod = UQ_4_12(2.0);
    return TRUE;
},
```

### Poison Status Bypass
- **Core Mechanic**: Can poison any Pokemon regardless of type
- **Affected Types**: Steel-type and Poison-type Pokemon (normally immune)
- **Status Types**: Works for both regular poison and bad poison
- **Implementation**: Uses `onCanStatusType` hook to override type immunity

```cpp
.onCanStatusType = +[](ABILITY_ON_CAN_STATUS_TYPE) -> int {
    CHECK(status & CHECK_POISON)
    return TRUE;
},
```

### Activation Conditions
1. **Type Effectiveness**: Activates when using Poison-type moves against Steel-type targets
2. **Status Infliction**: Activates when attempting to poison any target via moves, abilities, or items

### Affected Moves
**Poison-type offensive moves** (for type effectiveness):
- Sludge Bomb, Poison Jab, Gunk Shot, Sludge Wave, etc.
- All direct damage Poison-type moves gain super effectiveness vs Steel

**Poison-inflicting moves** (for status bypass):
- Toxic, Poison Gas, Poison Powder, Toxic Spikes
- Cross Poison, Poison Jab (secondary effect)
- Any move with poison chance secondary effects

### Strategic Implications
- **Steel Counter**: Transforms Steel-types from walls into vulnerable targets
- **Status Spreader**: Enables reliable poison status against traditional immunities
- **Stall Breaker**: Bypasses passive Steel-type walls and Poison-type tanks
- **Toxic Spikes Enhancement**: Makes entry hazard more universally threatening

### Interactions with Other Abilities
- **Overrides**: Type immunities (Steel/Poison to poison status)
- **Bypasses**: Natural Cure, Immunity, Poison Heal (for initial infliction)
- **Stacks With**: Poison Touch, Effect Spore (for additional poison chances)
- **Blocked By**: Magic Guard (prevents poison damage), Substitute (blocks status)

### Common Users
- **Salandit/Salazzle**: Primary users with fire/poison typing
- **Various Elite Redux Pokemon**: Multiple species have access as regular or innate ability
- **Grimer Line**: Some forms have access to this ability

### Competitive Usage
- **Role**: Wallbreaker and status spreader
- **Synergy**: Pairs well with Toxic Spikes setters and poison-type attackers
- **Threats**: Steel-type walls, Poison-type tanks, defensive cores
- **Teammates**: Benefits from entry hazard support and paralysis support

### Counters and Limitations
- **Magic Guard**: Prevents poison damage (but not initial status)
- **Substitute**: Blocks status moves entirely
- **Taunt**: Prevents non-damaging poison moves
- **Clerics**: Heal Bell, Aromatherapy remove poison status
- **Guts/Poison Heal**: Turn poison into advantage

### Damage Calculations
**Example vs Steel-type**:
- Base: Poison move vs Steel = 0.5x damage
- With Corrosion: Poison move vs Steel = 2.0x damage
- Net change: 4x damage increase

**Poison Status**:
- Regular poison: 1/8 max HP per turn
- Bad poison: Increasing damage (1/16, 2/16, 3/16, etc.)

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Enhanced implementation with comprehensive poison immunity bypass
- **Original**: Standard Corrosion from mainline games
- **Modifications**: Integrated with Elite Redux's expanded ability system and multi-ability framework
