# Celestial Blessing (ID: 591)

## Basic Description
Recovers 1/12 of its health each turn under Misty Terrain.

## Extended Description (295 characters)
Celestial Blessing activates during the end turn phase, restoring 1/12 of the Pokemon's maximum HP each turn, but only while the Pokemon is on the field under Misty Terrain. This recovery is blocked by Heal Block and similar effects. The ability provides consistent healing for Fairy-type teams.

## Detailed Mechanics

### Activation Conditions
- **Turn Phase**: End of turn
- **Terrain Requirement**: Must be affected by Misty Terrain
- **Health Requirement**: Cannot be at maximum HP
- **Healing Availability**: Must be able to heal (not blocked by Heal Block, etc.)
- **Turn Restriction**: Does not activate on the turn the Pokemon switches in

### Recovery Amount
- **Base Recovery**: 1/12 of maximum HP per turn
- **Minimum Recovery**: 1 HP (if 1/12 calculation results in 0)

### Implementation Details
- **Battle Script**: Uses `BattleScript_SelfSufficientActivates` for activation message
- **Terrain Check**: Uses `IsBattlerTerrainAffected(battler, STATUS_FIELD_MISTY_TERRAIN)`
- **Healing Check**: Uses `CanBattlerHeal(battler)` to verify healing is possible

### Strategic Applications

#### Team Synergy
- **Misty Surge**: Pairs excellently with Pokemon that can set Misty Terrain
- **Fairy Types**: Provides passive healing for Fairy-type cores
- **Terrain Control**: Encourages maintaining terrain control throughout battle

#### Defensive Utility
- **Passive Recovery**: Provides consistent healing without using move slots
- **Stall Potential**: Enables defensive strategies when combined with other recovery
- **Longevity**: Extends staying power in prolonged battles

#### Counters and Limitations
- **Terrain Dependency**: Completely ineffective without Misty Terrain
- **Heal Block**: Nullified by Heal Block and similar healing prevention
- **Terrain Override**: Disabled when other terrains replace Misty Terrain
- **Switch Timing**: No recovery on switch-in turn

### Related Abilities
- **Eternal Blessing**: Combines Celestial Blessing with Regenerator for enhanced recovery
- **Self Sufficient**: Similar end-turn healing but without terrain requirement (1/16 HP)
- **Peaceful Rest**: Similar concept but requires Fog weather (1/8 HP)

### Competitive Viability
- **Niche Usage**: Highly specialized for Misty Terrain teams
- **Defensive Core**: Strong in defensive teams with terrain support
- **Setup Potential**: Enables Pokemon to set up while maintaining health
- **Resource Management**: Reduces reliance on healing items and moves

### Code Reference
```cpp
constexpr Ability CelestialBlessing = {
    .onEndTurn = +[](ON_END_TURN) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(BATTLER_MAX_HP(battler))
        CHECK(CanBattlerHeal(battler))
        CHECK(gVolatileStructs[battler].isFirstTurn != 2)
        CHECK(IsBattlerTerrainAffected(battler, STATUS_FIELD_MISTY_TERRAIN))

        gBattleMoveDamage = gBattleMons[battler].maxHP / 12;
        if (gBattleMoveDamage == 0) gBattleMoveDamage = 1;
        gBattleMoveDamage *= -1;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_SelfSufficientActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
