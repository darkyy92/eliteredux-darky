# Resonance

Sound moves have a 50% chance to inflict bleeding on the target. Bleeding deals 1/16 max HP damage each turn. Cannot affect targets with existing status conditions, Rock-types, or Ghost-types. Sound moves include attacks with the sound flag or Normal moves from users with Reverbate ability.
