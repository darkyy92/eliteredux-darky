# Resonance - Ability ID 626

## In-Game Description
"Sound moves have 50% chance to inflict bleeding on the target."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Sound moves have a 50% chance to inflict bleeding on the target when landing a hit. Bleeding causes 1/16 max HP damage per turn, prevents healing, and negates the effects of stat stages. Rock and Ghost types are immune to bleeding.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Resonance is a sound-based ability that adds a dangerous bleeding effect to sonic attacks, creating sustained damage pressure through vibrational trauma.

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger Moves**: All moves with the sound flag
- **Activation Rate**: 50% chance per hit
- **Status Effect**: Bleeding (1/16 max HP damage per turn)
- **Duration**: Persistent until switch-out or cure

### Target Restrictions
- **Existing Status**: Cannot affect Pokemon with any status condition
- **Type Immunity**: Rock-types and Ghost-types are immune
- **Sound Immunity**: Blocked by Soundproof and similar abilities
- **Contact Independence**: Works with both contact and non-contact sound moves

### Compatible Moves
- **Hyper Voice**: Normal-type sound move
- **Boomburst**: Normal-type with high base power
- **Bug Buzz**: Bug-type special attack
- **Disarming Voice**: Fairy-type never-miss move
- **Round**: Normal-type that increases power with multiple users

### Strategic Applications
- **Status Pressure**: Adds utility to offensive sound moves
- **Sustained Damage**: Bleeding creates ongoing pressure
- **Sound Team Synergy**: Enhances sound-based strategies
- **Wall Breaking**: Helps wear down defensive Pokemon

### Notable Interactions
- **Multi-Hit Moves**: Each hit can trigger bleeding independently
- **Sound Immunity**: Completely blocked by sound-immune abilities
- **Healing**: Bleeding can be healed or cured by standard methods
- **Switching**: Bleeding effect ends when affected Pokemon switches out
