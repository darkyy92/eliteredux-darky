# Peaceful Rest

Peaceful Rest grants gradual healing during fog weather. When fog is active, the Pok√©mon restores 1/8 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn, provided it isn't at full health and can heal. This ability excels in prolonged battles, offering sustained recovery in foggy conditions.
