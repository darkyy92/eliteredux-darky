# Retribution Blow Analysis

**ID:** 407  
**Name:** Retribution Blow  
**Current Description:** "Uses Hyper Beam if any foe uses an stat boosting move."

## Answer to User's Question: "Does the Hyper Beam put you in recharge?"

**NO, the Hyper Beam from Retribution Blow does NOT cause recharge status.**

This is because of a specific check in the recharge effect implementation:

```c
case MOVE_EFFECT_RECHARGE:
    if (!gProcessingExtraAttacks) {
        gBattleMons[gEffectBattler].status2 |= STATUS2_RECHARGE;
        gVolatileStructs[gEffectBattler].rechargeTimer = 2;
        gLockedMoves[gEffectBattler] = gCurrentMove;
    }
    break;
```

When `gProcessingExtraAttacks` is true (which it is for abilities like Retribution Blow that use `UseOutOfTurnAttack`), the recharge status is **completely skipped**.

## Implementation Analysis

### Trigger Mechanism
- **Hook:** `onReactive` - This activates when stat stage checks are performed
- **Condition:** Any positive stat change (`> 0`) on the attacking opponent
- **Stat Check:** Loops through all stats (ATK, DEF, SPA, SPD, SPE) checking `gBattleStruct->statChangesToCheck[gBattlerAttacker][stat - 1]`

### Code Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability RetributionBlow = {
    .onReactive = +[](ON_REACTIVE) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(gTurnStructs[battler].dancerUsedMove)
        CHECK(IsBattlerAlive(gBattlerAttacker))
        CHECK(gCurrentTurnActionNumber < gBattlersCount || gProcessingExtraAttacks)
        CHECK(gBattleStruct->statStageCheckState != STAT_STAGE_CHECK_NOT_NEEDED)
        for (int stat = STAT_ATK; stat < NUM_STATS; stat++) {
            if (gBattleStruct->statChangesToCheck[gBattlerAttacker][stat - 1] > 0) {
                UseOutOfTurnAttack(battler, gBattlerAttacker, ability, MOVE_HYPER_BEAM, 0);
                return FALSE;
            }
        }
        return FALSE;
    },
};
```

### Key Mechanics
1. **Trigger:** When any opponent uses a move that boosts any stat
2. **Attack:** Launches a 150 BP Normal-type Hyper Beam 
3. **No Recharge:** The extra attack system bypasses recharge effects
4. **Once Per Turn:** Protected by the extra attack system's dancer check
5. **Accuracy:** 100% accuracy, affected by normal accuracy checks
6. **Target:** Targets the specific opponent who used the stat-boosting move

### Strategic Implications
- This makes Retribution Blow extremely powerful as it provides a free 150 BP attack without drawbacks
- Punishes setup sweepers and stat-boosting strategies heavily
- The lack of recharge means the user can continue normal attacks next turn
- Forces opponents to be very careful about when they set up

## Extended In-Game Description (280-300 chars)
"Automatically uses 150 BP Hyper Beam against opponents that boost stats. The triggered Hyper Beam has no recharge period, allowing normal actions next turn. Punishes setup sweepers with immediate retaliation. 100% accuracy, Normal-type damage with no drawbacks."

## Detailed Explanation for Discord
**Retribution Blow** is a reactive ability that automatically triggers a powerful counterattack when opponents attempt to boost their stats. Here's exactly how it works:

**Trigger Condition:** Any time an opponent uses a move that increases any of their stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed), Retribution Blow activates.

**The Counterattack:** The user immediately launches a 150 BP Normal-type Hyper Beam at the stat-boosting opponent with 100% accuracy.

**Critical Mechanic:** Unlike normal Hyper Beam usage, the triggered attack does NOT cause recharge status. This is because it uses the extra attack system (`gProcessingExtraAttacks = true`), which explicitly bypasses recharge effects in the move effect code.

**Strategic Impact:** This ability is a massive deterrent to setup strategies. Pokemon with Retribution Blow essentially get a free 150 BP attack every time an opponent tries to set up, with no drawback. This makes it extremely punishing against:
- Setup sweepers using moves like Dragon Dance, Nasty Plot, etc.
- Support Pokemon using stat-boosting moves
- Any strategy relying on stat increases

The ability ensures that stat-boosting always comes with immediate, severe consequences while leaving the user free to act normally on their next turn.
