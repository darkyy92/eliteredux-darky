# Zero To Hero - Ability ID 561

## In-Game Description
"Changes forms after switching out."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Zero To Hero triggers Palafin's heroic transformation after being switched out and back in. Upon re-entry, Palafin transforms from its Zero Form to its mighty Hero Form, gaining massive stat boosts to Attack, Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense while keeping the same HP and Speed stats.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Core Mechanics:**
- Exclusive to Palafin species (ID 964)
- Requires switching out and back in to activate
- Single-use per battle entry (uses GetSingleUseAbilityCounter system)
- Cannot be suppressed (unsuppressable = TRUE)
- Banned from randomizer (randomizerBanned = TRUE)

**Transformation Details:**
- Base Form (Palafin): HP 100, ATK 70, DEF 72, SpATK 53, SpDEF 62, SPE 100
- Hero Form (Palafin-Hero): HP 100, ATK 160, DEF 97, SpATK 106, SpDEF 87, SPE 100
- Stat changes: +90 ATK, +25 DEF, +53 SpATK, +25 SpDEF (no change to HP/Speed)

**Technical Implementation:**
```cpp
constexpr Ability ZeroToHero = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK(gBattleMons[battler].species == SPECIES_PALAFIN)
        CHECK_NOT(gBattleMons[battler].status2 & STATUS2_TRANSFORMED)
        CHECK(GetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability))

        UpdateAbilityStateIndicesForNewSpecies(battler, SPECIES_PALAFIN_HERO);
        gBattleMons[battler].species = SPECIES_PALAFIN_HERO;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_AttackerFormChangeEnd3);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onExit = +[](ON_EXIT) -> int {
        SetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability, TRUE);
        return FALSE;
    },
    .unsuppressable = TRUE,
    .randomizerBanned = TRUE,
};
```

**Activation Requirements:**
1. Must be Palafin (not already transformed)
2. Must not have the STATUS2_TRANSFORMED flag
3. Must have available single-use counter (first entry after switch)
4. Sets single-use counter on switch out to prevent repeated transformations

**Form Differences:**
- Hero Form has different abilities: Friend Guard, Avenger, Damp
- Hero Form has different innate abilities: Zero To Hero, Justified, Adaptability
- Uses same learnset and movepool
- Different visual sprite and icon

**Competitive Applications:**
- Enables pivot strategy: switch out to reset transformation capability
- Massive Attack boost (70 to 160) makes Hero Form a powerful physical sweeper
- Defensive improvements help survive hits better than base form
- Single-use restriction prevents easy spam but rewards strategic switching
- Works well with U-turn/Volt Switch team compositions

**Strategic Usage:**
- Switch Palafin in early to scout, then switch out
- Bring back later in battle for surprise transformation and sweep attempt
- Consider using with entry hazard support to maximize switch-in value
- Pair with moves like Jet Punch or Wave Crash to utilize the massive Attack boost
