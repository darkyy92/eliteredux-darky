# Leaf Guard - Ability ID 102

## In-Game Description
"Cures own status at the end of every turn in sun."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Leaf Guard cures the Pokemon's status conditions at the end of each turn during sunny weather. Works with regular sun, harsh sunlight from Drought, and extremely harsh sunlight from Desolate Land. Status healing occurs after damage from burn/poison. Pairs well with sun teams.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Leaf Guard is a defensive ability that provides automatic status condition recovery during sunny weather conditions. The ability activates at the end of each turn when sun is active.

### Activation Conditions
- **Weather requirement**: Any form of sunny weather must be active
  - Regular sun (from Sunny Day or Drought)
  - Harsh sunlight (from Drought ability)
  - Extremely harsh sunlight (from Desolate Land)
- **Timing**: Activates at the end of turn, after all other end-of-turn effects
- **Status cure**: Removes all major status conditions:
  - Burn
  - Freeze
  - Paralysis
  - Poison (including badly poisoned)
  - Sleep

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Leaf Guard triggers at end of turn during sun
if (ability == ABILITY_LEAF_GUARD && IsWeatherSunny()) {
    // Cure status conditions
    if (battler->status1 != STATUS1_NONE) {
        battler->status1 = STATUS1_NONE;
        // Trigger status cure message
    }
}
```

### Important Interactions
- **Status damage timing**: Burn and poison damage still occur before the cure
- **Sleep Talk**: Can still use Sleep Talk on the turn you wake up
- **Rest**: Can use Rest and wake up same turn in sun
- **Toxic damage**: Resets badly poisoned counter when cured
- **Ability suppression**: Doesn't work if ability is suppressed

### Weather Duration
In Elite Redux, weather effects last 8 turns (not 5 like vanilla), making weather-based abilities more valuable.

### Strategic Implications
- **Sun team synergy**: Excellent on sun teams for status immunity
- **Status absorber**: Can switch into status moves freely in sun
- **Rest abuse**: Can use Rest for full recovery without sleep drawback
- **Anti-stall**: Counters toxic stall and burn strategies
- **Weather dependent**: Vulnerable when sun isn't active

### Common Users
- Grass-type Pokemon who benefit from sun
- Pokemon with Chlorophyll as secondary ability
- Sun team supporters and sweepers
- Bulky Grass types that fear status

### Competitive Usage Notes
- Pairs excellently with Drought setters
- Provides pseudo-immunity to status in sun
- Allows aggressive Rest usage for longevity
- Less reliable than status immunity abilities due to weather dependency
- Can be paired with Heat Rock for extended sun duration

### Counters
- **Weather override**: Change weather to disable the ability
- **Cloud Nine/Air Lock**: Negates weather effects
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas
- **Multi-hit moves**: Can break through before status cure
- **Entry hazards**: Not affected by Leaf Guard

### Synergies
- **Drought/Sunny Day**: Essential for ability activation
- **Solar Beam/Solar Blade**: No charge in same weather
- **Synthesis/Moonlight**: Enhanced recovery in sun
- **Growth**: Doubled stat boost in sun
- **Fire-type coverage**: Boosted in sun weather

### Version History
- Standard ability since Generation IV
- In Elite Redux, benefits from 8-turn weather duration
- Can be an innate ability on certain Grass-type Pokemon
