# Limber - Ability ID 7

## In-Game Description
"Immune to paralysis. Takes 50% less recoil damage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Prevents paralysis and absorbs impact from recoil moves. Cannot be paralyzed by any means and takes only half damage from recoil effects, including crash damage. Makes Brave Bird and Double-Edge spammable, while High Jump Kick miss only costs 25% HP instead of 50%.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Limber provides two distinct defensive benefits:

1. **Paralysis Immunity**
   - Complete immunity to paralysis status
   - Removes existing paralysis when gained
   - Prevents paralysis from all sources (Thunder Wave, Static, Body Slam, etc.)
   - Shows ability popup when paralysis is attempted

2. **Recoil Reduction (50%)**
   - All recoil damage is halved
   - Applies to move recoil (Double-Edge, Brave Bird, etc.)
   - Applies to crash damage (High Jump Kick miss)
   - Applies to Mind Blown and Steel Beam self-damage

### Technical Implementation

**Code Structure** (`src/abilities.cc`):
```cpp
constexpr Ability Limber = {
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_PARALYSIS)
        return TRUE;
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .halfRecoil = TRUE,
    .removesStatusOnImmunity = TRUE,
};
```

### Key Properties
- **Breakable**: Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker, Gastro Acid, etc.
- **Status Removal**: Cures paralysis if gained while paralyzed
- **Half Recoil Flag**: Reduces all forms of recoil by 50%

### Recoil Calculation Examples
For a Pokemon using Brave Bird (120 BP, 33% recoil):
- Normal: Deals 120 damage, takes 40 recoil
- With Limber: Deals 120 damage, takes **20 recoil**

For High Jump Kick miss:
- Normal: Loses 50% max HP
- With Limber: Loses **25% max HP**

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Reckless**: Boosts recoil move damage, Limber reduces the recoil
- **Rock Head**: Complete recoil immunity vs Limber's 50% reduction
- **Magic Guard**: Also provides recoil immunity
- **Sheer Force**: Removes recoil entirely for affected moves
- **Thunder Wave**: Completely blocked by Limber

### Strategic Implications
1. **Physical Sweeper**: Safely use powerful recoil moves
2. **Speed Tier Maintenance**: No paralysis speed drops
3. **Pivot**: Switch into predicted Thunder Wave
4. **Recoil Attacker**: Brave Bird, Double-Edge become more spammable
5. **Risk Mitigation**: High Jump Kick less punishing on miss

### Common Strategies
- **Recoil Spam**: Use high-power recoil moves repeatedly
- **Paralysis Bait**: Switch into obvious Thunder Wave attempts
- **Life Orb Synergy**: Already taking chip damage, recoil reduction helps
- **Choice Band**: Maximum power with reduced drawback

### Competitive Usage Notes
- High-tier ability for physical attackers
- Enables recoil move spam strategies
- Excellent on fast, frail attackers
- Paralysis immunity maintains offensive pressure
- Particularly valuable in paralysis-heavy metagames

### Affected Moves (Recoil Reduction)
**Recoil Moves**: Brave Bird, Double-Edge, Flare Blitz, Head Smash, Submission, Take Down, Volt Tackle, Wild Charge, Wood Hammer

**Crash Moves**: High Jump Kick, Jump Kick

**Other**: Mind Blown, Steel Beam, Shadow End, Light of Ruin

### Common Users
- Persian (original user)
- Hitmonlee (benefits from HJK safety)
- Various Normal-types with Double-Edge
- Physical attackers with recoil moves

### Counters
- **Burn**: Alternative speed/damage reduction
- **Intimidate**: Reduces physical damage output
- **Static/Flame Body**: Contact punishments still work
- **Priority moves**: Bypass speed advantage
- **Gastro Acid**: Removes the ability

### Synergies
- **Swords Dance**: Set up then spam recoil moves
- **Healing support**: Offset remaining recoil
- **Tailwind**: Stack speed control
- **Healing Wish**: Full restore after recoil accumulation
- **Choice items**: Maximum damage output

### Version History
- **Original**: Only paralysis immunity
- **Elite Redux**: Added 50% recoil reduction for offensive utility
