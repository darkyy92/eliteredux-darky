# Volt Rush - Ability ID 430

## In-Game Description
"At full HP, gives +1 priority to its Electric-type moves."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Volt Rush grants +1 priority to all Electric-type moves when the Pokémon is at full HP. Works with all Electric moves including special and physical attacks. Priority is lost immediately when HP drops below maximum. Returns when HP is restored to full through healing moves or items.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Volt Rush is a priority-boosting ability that functions identically to Gale Wings but specifically for Electric-type moves. It provides a significant speed advantage by allowing Electric moves to strike first, but only when the user maintains perfect health.

### Activation Conditions
- **HP requirement**: Pokémon must be at exactly full HP (100% of max HP)
- **Move type**: Only affects Electric-type moves
- **Priority boost**: Adds exactly +1 to move priority
- **Immediate loss**: Priority bonus is lost the instant HP drops below maximum

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Volt Rush uses the GALE_WINGS_CLONE macro for Electric type
constexpr Ability VoltRush = {
    .onPriority = GALE_WINGS_CLONE(TYPE_ELECTRIC),
};

// The macro implementation:
#define GALE_WINGS_CLONE(type)                               \
    +[](ON_PRIORITY) -> int {                                \
        CHECK(GetTypeBeforeUsingMove(move, battler) == type) \
        CHECK(BATTLER_MAX_HP(battler))                       \
        return 1;                                            \
    }

// Where BATTLER_MAX_HP is defined as:
#define BATTLER_MAX_HP(battlerId)(gBattleMons[battlerId].hp == gBattleMons[battlerId].maxHP)
```

### Important Interactions
- **Move typing**: Uses move's type after same-type conversion (e.g., Normalize, Aerilate)
- **Priority brackets**: Creates new priority bracket between +0 and +1
- **Multiple priority**: Stacks additively with other priority-boosting effects
- **Substitute**: Taking damage behind Substitute still disables the ability
- **Status conditions**: Burn, poison, and other damage-over-time effects disable priority

### Priority System Integration
- **Normal moves**: 0 priority → Electric moves get +1 priority at full HP
- **Quick Attack**: +1 priority → Electric moves match this speed tier
- **Extreme Speed**: +2 priority → Still faster than Volt Rush Electric moves
- **Within same priority**: Speed stats determine order as normal

### HP Management Considerations
- **Healing moves**: Roost, Recover, etc. can restore priority by reaching full HP
- **Leftovers/berries**: Gradual healing can restore the ability's effectiveness
- **Entry hazards**: Stealth Rock damage immediately disables priority on switch-in
- **Recoil moves**: Self-inflicted damage from moves like Volt Tackle disables ability
- **Life Orb**: Damage from Life Orb disables priority after first use

### Strategic Implications
- **Opening game**: Extremely powerful for first-turn positioning and revenge killing
- **Momentum control**: Allows slower Electric types to act as priority revenge killers
- **Entry hazard vulnerability**: Stealth Rock weakness significantly impacts usability
- **Risk-reward gameplay**: High reward for maintaining full HP, severe penalty for any damage
- **Team support**: Benefits from hazard control and healing support

### Common Users
Electric-type Pokémon that want to leverage priority for:
- **Revenge killing**: Finishing off weakened opponents
- **Speed control**: Outpacing naturally faster threats
- **First-turn advantage**: Getting crucial moves off before taking damage
- **Late-game cleanup**: Sweeping with priority Electric moves

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Hazard weakness**: Stealth Rock severely limits switch-in opportunities
- **One-time use**: Often only effective once per battle due to HP requirement
- **Type coverage**: Limited to Electric moves reduces coverage options
- **Speed tier relevance**: Most valuable on naturally slower Pokémon
- **Item synergy**: Focus Sash can preserve HP for one crucial turn

### Counters
- **Entry hazards**: Stealth Rock, Spikes immediately disable ability
- **Multi-hit moves**: Guarantee HP loss to disable priority
- **Status conditions**: Burn, poison disable through damage over time
- **Priority moves**: Higher priority moves (+2 or higher) still move first
- **Thunder Wave**: Paralysis speed reduction paired with priority loss
- **Sandstorm/Hail**: Weather damage removes priority bonus

### Synergies
- **Rapid Spin/Defog**: Essential hazard removal for maintaining full HP
- **Healing Wish**: Full restoration can reactivate the ability
- **Aromatherapy/Heal Bell**: Status cure prevents damage over time
- **Electric Terrain**: Boosts Electric move power while maintaining priority
- **Focus Sash**: Preserves full HP through one otherwise fatal hit
- **Sturdy**: Similar HP preservation synergy on some users

### Move Interactions
Electric moves that benefit from Volt Rush priority:
- **Thunderbolt**: Reliable STAB priority option
- **Thunder**: High power with paralysis chance at priority
- **Volt Tackle**: Extreme power but recoil disables ability after use
- **Thunder Wave**: Priority paralysis support
- **Discharge**: AoE priority damage in doubles
- **Electro Ball**: Variable power based on speed differences

### Version History
- Introduced in Elite Redux as part of the expanded ability system
