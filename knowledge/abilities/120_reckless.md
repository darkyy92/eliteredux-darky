# Reckless - Ability ID 120

## In-Game Description
"Moves causing recoil damage deal 1.2x more damage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Increases the damage of moves that cause recoil by 20%. While enraged, this boost applies to all moves.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Damage Boost**: 1.2x multiplier (20% increase) applied to moves with recoil damage
- **Activation**: Only affects moves that have the `FLAG_RECKLESS_BOOST` flag
- **Recoil Unchanged**: The ability boosts the damage dealt but does not increase or decrease the recoil damage taken

**Technical Implementation:**
```cpp
constexpr Ability Reckless = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            if (gBattleMoves[move].flags & FLAG_RECKLESS_BOOST) MUL(1.2);
        },
};
```

**Affected Moves:**
Reckless affects all moves that cause recoil damage to the user, including but not limited to:
- **Double-Edge**: 33% recoil damage
- **Brave Bird**: 33% recoil damage
- **Flare Blitz**: 33% recoil damage, 10% burn chance
- **Wood Hammer**: 33% recoil damage
- **Volt Tackle**: 25% recoil damage, 10% paralyze chance
- **Dragon Rush**: 33% recoil damage, 20% flinch chance
- **Submission**: 33% recoil damage
- **Head Smash**: Rock-type recoil move
- **Wild Charge**: Electric-type recoil move
- **Take Down**: Normal-type recoil move

**Damage Calculation Example:**
- Base Brave Bird power: 120
- With Reckless: 120 x 1.2 = 144 effective power
- Recoil damage: Still 33% of damage dealt (not increased)

**Strategic Applications:**
1. **Offensive Powerhouse**: Turns already powerful recoil moves into devastating attacks
2. **Risk-Reward**: Balances increased damage output with life-risking recoil
3. **Synergies**: Works exceptionally well with:
   - Rock Head (negates recoil entirely)
   - Recovery moves or items (Roost, Leftovers)
   - High HP Pokemon that can handle recoil better

**Common Users:**
- Physical attackers with access to multiple recoil moves
- Pokemon that can learn both Reckless and recovery options
- Fast sweepers that aim to KO before recoil becomes problematic

**Competitive Notes:**
- The 20% damage boost makes recoil moves extremely threatening
- Requires careful HP management due to accumulated recoil damage
- Often paired with priority moves to secure KOs when at low HP
- Can break through bulky walls that would normally survive unboosted attacks

**Interaction Notes:**
- Does not stack with other damage-boosting abilities
- The boost applies before other damage modifiers in the calculation
- Works with all recoil moves regardless of type or category (physical/special)
