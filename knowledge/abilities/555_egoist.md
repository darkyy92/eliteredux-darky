# Egoist - Ability ID 555

## In-Game Description
"Raises its own stats when foes raise theirs."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Egoist copies stat boosts that enemy Pokemon receive and applies them to itself. When any opponent increases their Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Accuracy, the Egoist user gains the same stat boosts instantly. Perfect for countering setup sweepers.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Core Mechanics:**
- Egoist activates whenever any opponent gains positive stat boosts (+1, +2, etc.)
- The ability copies the exact same stat increases to the Egoist user
- Works on all battle stats: Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Accuracy
- Multiple opponents' boosts are additive (if two foes each boost +1 Attack, Egoist user gets +2 Attack)

**Activation Conditions:**
- Triggers on any positive stat change from opposing Pokemon
- Works with moves, abilities, items, or any other stat-boosting effects
- Only affects enemy stat boosts - ally boosts are ignored
- Must be alive and on the field when stat boosts occur

**Technical Implementation:**
```c
constexpr Ability Egoist = {
    .onReactive = +[](ON_REACTIVE) -> int {
        // Check if stat stage checking is needed
        CHECK(gBattleStruct->statStageCheckState != STAT_STAGE_CHECK_NOT_NEEDED)
        
        // Loop through all opponents
        for (int opponent = GetOppositeSide(battler); opponent < gBattlersCount; opponent += 2) {
            // Check each stat for positive changes
            for (int stat = STAT_ATK; stat < ARRAY_COUNT(gBattleStruct->statChangesToCheck[opponent]); stat++) {
                if (gBattleStruct->statChangesToCheck[opponent][stat - 1] > 0) {
                    // Trigger copy stat effects
                    BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_PerformCopyStatEffects);
                    return TRUE;
                }
            }
        }
        return FALSE;
    },
};
```

**Copy Process:**
```c
// In VARIOUS_DO_COPY_STAT_CHANGE:
for (otherBattler = 0; otherBattler < gBattlersCount; otherBattler++) {
    if (GetBattlerSide(otherBattler) == GetBattlerSide(battler)) continue; // Skip allies
    if (gBattleStruct->statChangesToCheck[otherBattler][state.stat - 1] > 0)
        change += gBattleStruct->statChangesToCheck[otherBattler][state.stat - 1]; // Add boosts
}
```

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Anti-Setup Tool**: Completely negates setup strategies by copying all boosts
- **Doubles/Multi-Battle Advantage**: Gets multiplicative benefits when multiple opponents boost
- **Immediate Response**: No delay - boosts are copied instantly when opponents boost
- **Passive Defensive Option**: Requires no move slots, works automatically

**Example Scenarios:**
1. **Dragon Dance Counter**: Opponent uses Dragon Dance (+1 Attack, +1 Speed) to Egoist user also gets +1 Attack, +1 Speed
2. **Multiple Opponents**: In doubles, if both opponents boost +1 Attack to Egoist user gets +2 Attack total
3. **Calm Mind Chain**: Opponent uses Calm Mind (+1 SpAtk, +1 SpDef) to Egoist user matches the boosts

**Damage Calculations:**
- No direct damage - purely stat-based
- Copied boosts follow normal stat calculation formulas:
  - +1 stage = 1.5x multiplier
  - +2 stages = 2.0x multiplier
  - +3 stages = 2.5x multiplier
  - And so on...

**Common Users:**
Based on SpeciesList.textproto analysis, Egoist appears on several Pokemon as both regular and innate abilities, making it accessible across different team compositions.

**Competitive Usage Notes:**
- **Meta Positioning**: Excellent against setup-heavy metagames
- **Team Role**: Best used on defensive/support Pokemon that can capitalize on copied boosts
- **Timing**: Most effective when opponents are forced to boost early (speed control, sweeper preparation)

**Counters:**
- **Stat Resets**: Haze, Clear Smog, and other stat-clearing moves
- **Physical Attacks**: Directly attacking instead of boosting bypasses the ability
- **Negative Priority**: Using moves that lower opponent's stats instead of raising your own
- **Ability Suppression**: Gastro Acid, Simple Beam, or other ability-changing moves

**Synergies:**
- **Baton Pass Teams**: Can copy boosts then pass them to dedicated sweepers
- **Defensive Cores**: Combines well with recovery moves and status spreading
- **Speed Control**: Copied Speed boosts help with turn order manipulation
- **Multi-Hit Moves**: Benefits from copied Attack boosts with moves like Bullet Seed

**Version History:**
- Added in Elite Redux as part of the expanded ability roster
- Functions as a unique anti-setup tool in the competitive metagame
- Implementation uses the reactive ability system for immediate triggering
