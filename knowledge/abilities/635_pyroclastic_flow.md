## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Pyroclastic Flow is a compound ability that combines two powerful type effectiveness manipulation abilities, creating devastating offensive options against traditionally resistant types.

### Core Mechanics
- **Molten Down Effect**: Fire-type moves deal super effective damage to Rock-types
- **Corrosion Effect**: Poison-type moves deal super effective damage to Steel-types

- **Dual Benefits**: Both effects apply simultaneously

### Type Effectiveness Changes
- **Fire vs Rock**: Fire moves become super effective (2x) against Rock types
- **Poison vs Steel**: Poison moves become super effective (2x) against Steel types
- **Poison Immunity**: Steel and Poison types can be poisoned despite normal immunity

### Strategic Applications
- **Type Coverage**: Provides exceptional coverage against defensive types

- **Status Utility**: Enables poison strategies against normally immune types
- **Offensive Pressure**: Creates unexpected type advantages

### Notable Interactions
