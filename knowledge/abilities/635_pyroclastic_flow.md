# Pyroclastic Flow - Ability ID 635

## In-Game Description
"Combines Molten Down and Corrosion effects."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Makes Fire-type moves super effective against Rock-types instead of resisted. Poison-type moves become super effective against Steel-type Pokemon. Additionally, this Pokemon can inflict poison status on any type.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Pyroclastic Flow is a compound ability that combines two powerful type effectiveness manipulation abilities, creating devastating offensive options against traditionally resistant types.

### Core Mechanics
- **Molten Down Effect**: Fire-type moves deal super effective damage to Rock-types
- **Corrosion Effect**: Poison-type moves deal super effective damage to Steel-types
- **Poison Immunity Override**: Can poison Steel and Poison-type Pokemon
- **Dual Benefits**: Both effects apply simultaneously

### Type Effectiveness Changes
- **Fire vs Rock**: Fire moves become super effective (2x) against Rock types
- **Poison vs Steel**: Poison moves become super effective (2x) against Steel types
- **Poison Immunity**: Steel and Poison types can be poisoned despite normal immunity
- **Status Override**: Bypasses typical poison immunities

### Strategic Applications
- **Type Coverage**: Provides exceptional coverage against defensive types
- **Wall Breaking**: Breaks through Rock and Steel defensive walls
- **Status Utility**: Enables poison strategies against normally immune types
- **Offensive Pressure**: Creates unexpected type advantages

### Notable Interactions
- **STAB Enhancement**: Fire and Poison STAB moves become extremely threatening
- **Coverage Moves**: Makes Fire and Poison coverage moves much more viable
- **Defensive Counters**: Completely changes defensive calculations for opponents
- **Team Support**: Benefits teammates with Fire or Poison moves
