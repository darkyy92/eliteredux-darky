# Blight Scale - Ability ID 779

## In-Game Description
"Multiscale + Poison Point"

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Reduces all incoming damage by 50% when the Pokemon is at max HP. Multiplicative with other sources of damage reduction. Has a 30% chance to inflict poison on contact moves, both when attacking and being attacked.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Blight Scale is a powerful defensive combination ability that merges two distinct protective mechanisms:

**Multiscale Component:**
- When the Pokemon is at maximum HP (current HP = max HP), all incoming damage is reduced by 50%
- This damage reduction applies to all attacks that would deal damage
- The effect is lost as soon as the Pokemon takes any damage (no longer at 100% HP)
- This component is breakable by abilities like Mold Breaker

**Poison Point Component:**
- When an opponent makes contact with this Pokemon using a contact move, there's a 30% chance the attacker becomes poisoned
- Only triggers if the opponent can be poisoned (not already statused, not immune to poison)
- Only activates on moves that make physical contact
- Works regardless of the Pokemon's current HP status

**Strategic Applications:**
- Excellent on bulky Pokemon that can leverage the initial damage reduction
- Forces opponents to use non-contact moves or risk poison status
- Creates a "lose-lose" situation where opponents either avoid contact (limiting move options) or risk status
- Particularly effective on Pokemon with recovery moves to potentially regain full HP and reactivate Multiscale
- The poison chance provides ongoing pressure even after Multiscale is broken

**Counters and Limitations:**
- Mold Breaker ignores the Multiscale component
- Non-contact moves bypass the Poison Point component entirely
- Once damaged, loses the crucial damage reduction until healed to full
- Pokemon immune to poison (Steel/Poison types, or abilities like Immunity) ignore the contact punishment
- Multi-hit moves can break Multiscale on the first hit, then deal full damage on subsequent hits

This ability is particularly dangerous in formats where switching and prediction are key, as it punishes both physical attackers and forces careful move selection from opponents.
