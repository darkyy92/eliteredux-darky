# Sweet Veil - Ability ID 175

## In-Game Description
"This Pokemon and its ally are immune to sleep."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Sweet Veil provides sleep immunity to both the user and their ally in doubles battles. This ability prevents Sleep status from moves like Sleep Powder, Hypnosis, and Spore. The protection extends to the ally even if they don't have Sweet Veil themselves. Cannot be suppressed but can be broken.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Sweet Veil is a sleep immunity ability that works for both the user and their ally in doubles battles. Here's how it functions mechanically:

### Core Functionality
- **Status Immunity**: Provides immunity to all sleep-inducing effects (CHECK_SLEEP status flag)
- **Ally Protection**: Uses `.onStatusImmuneFor = APPLY_ON_ALLY` to extend protection to allied Pokemon
- **Breakable**: Can be disabled by abilities like Mold Breaker, Turboblaze, or Teravolt
- **No Status Removal**: Unlike some immunity abilities, it doesn't automatically cure existing sleep

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability SweetVeil = {
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_SLEEP)
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onStatusImmuneFor = APPLY_ON_ALLY,
    .breakable = TRUE,
};
```

### Sleep Sources Protected Against
- Direct sleep moves (Sleep Powder, Hypnosis, Spore, etc.)
- Sleep from abilities (Effect Spore when it rolls sleep)
- Sleep from items or other battle effects
- Rest is still usable (as it's self-induced and bypasses immunity)

### Battle Format Differences
- **Singles**: Only protects the user
- **Doubles/Multi**: Protects both the user and their ally
- **Ally dies**: Protection is lost for remaining Pokemon if Sweet Veil user faints

### Interaction Notes
- Does not prevent self-induced sleep (Rest)
- Can be bypassed by mold breaker-type abilities
- Works even if the ally has a different ability
- Functions similar to Aroma Veil but specifically for sleep immunity
- The ally gets the protection regardless of their position or ability

### Comparison with Similar Abilities
- **Insomnia/Vital Spirit**: Only protects the user, but also removes existing sleep
- **Aroma Veil**: Protects from multiple status conditions but not sleep specifically
- **Sweet Veil**: Unique in providing sleep immunity to both user and ally
