# Chunky Bass Line - Ability ID 641

## In-Game Description
After using any sound-based move, triggers an earthquake.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

This rhythmic ability creates powerful seismic vibrations that shake the battlefield after every sound-based attack. When the Pokemon uses any move with the sound flag, the intense bass frequencies resonate through the ground, triggering a localized earthquake that damages nearby opponents.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Mechanics

- **Trigger Condition:** Activates after successfully using any sound move
- **Follow-up Effect:** Automatically uses Earthquake with 40 Base Power
- **Target Selection:** Follows standard Earthquake targeting (hits adjacent Pokemon in doubles/triples)
- **Damage Calculation:** Uses the user's Attack stat and typing effectiveness
- **Priority:** Executes immediately after the original sound move resolves

### Strategic Applications

**Offensive Synergy:**
- Pairs excellently with sound moves like Hyper Voice, Boomburst, or Echoed Voice
- Creates dual-type coverage (original move + Ground-type follow-up)
- Punishes Pokemon that resist the initial sound move but are weak to Ground

**Battlefield Control:**
- Forces switches from Ground-weak Pokemon
- Applies consistent pressure with guaranteed follow-up damage
- Effective against Electric-types that commonly resist sound moves

### Sound Move Examples

Sound moves that trigger this ability include:
- Hyper Voice, Boomburst (high power)
- Echoed Voice, Round (building power)
- Screech, Metal Sound (status-based)
- Bug Buzz, Disarming Voice (special effects)
- Any Normal-type move when paired with Reverbate ability

### Counters and Limitations

- Flying-types and Levitate users immune to the Earthquake follow-up
- Soundproof blocks the initial trigger move entirely
- Throat Chop prevents sound moves for several turns
- Lower Base Power (40) makes the follow-up less threatening than full Earthquake
