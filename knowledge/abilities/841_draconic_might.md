# Draconic Might

**ID**: 841  
**Description**: Draconize + Half Drake.

## Extended In-Game Description
Transforms the Pokémon into a mighty dragon warrior by adding Dragon as a third type and converting all Normal-type moves to Dragon-type. Normal moves become Dragon attacks that gain STAB (1.5x damage) from the added Dragon typing, turning basic attacks into powerful draconic strikes.

## Mechanics

### Type Addition (Half Drake Component)
- Adds Dragon as a third type upon entering battle
- Dragon type cannot be removed by type-changing moves
- Grants STAB bonus to all Dragon-type moves

### Move Conversion (Draconize Component)
- Converts Normal-type moves to Dragon-type before damage calculation
- Converted moves receive STAB bonus from the added Dragon typing
- Works with physical and special Normal-type moves
- Does not affect status moves

### Damage Calculation
- Normal-type moves → Dragon-type moves
- Dragon-type moves get 1.5x STAB multiplier
- Combined effect: Normal moves deal 1.5x damage as Dragon-type
- Stacks with Adaptability for 2.0x STAB if present

## In-Game Appearance

When a Pokémon with Draconic Might enters battle:
1. "**[Pokémon] added the Dragon type!**" message appears
2. The Pokémon gains Dragon as a third type
3. All Normal-type attacks will hit as Dragon-type moves

## Competitive Analysis

### Advantages
- Transforms weak Normal moves into powerful Dragon attacks
- Provides excellent neutral coverage with Dragon-type
- Synergizes with high base power Normal moves (Return, Hyper Beam, etc.)
- Dragon STAB on a non-Dragon Pokémon can catch opponents off-guard

### Disadvantages
- Adds Dragon's weaknesses (Ice, Dragon, Fairy)
- Converted moves face Dragon immunities (Fairy-types)
- Steel-types resist Dragon moves
- Requires Normal-type moves in moveset to fully utilize

### Notable Interactions
- Multi-hit Normal moves (e.g., Tail Slap) become multi-hit Dragon moves
- Priority Normal moves (e.g., Fake Out, Quick Attack) become Dragon-type priority
- Works with sound-based Normal moves (e.g., Hyper Voice)
- Hidden Power (if Normal-type) converts to Dragon

## Comparison with Similar Abilities

- **Draconize**: Only converts moves, doesn't add Dragon typing
- **Half Drake**: Only adds Dragon type, doesn't convert moves
- **Aerilate/Pixilate/Refrigerate**: Similar -ate abilities for other types
- **Dragonfly**: Combines Half Drake with Levitate instead of move conversion

## Example Scenario

A Pokémon with Draconic Might uses Return:
- Return (Normal, 102 BP) → Dragon-type Return
- Gains STAB from added Dragon typing
- Final damage: 102 × 1.5 = 153 effective base power
- Hits as Dragon-type for type effectiveness

This ability essentially creates a pseudo-Dragon type that can utilize Normal-type movepool as Dragon STAB, offering unique offensive opportunities.
