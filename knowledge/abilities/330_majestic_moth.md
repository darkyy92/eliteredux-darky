# Majestic Moth - Ability ID 330

## In-Game Description
"Boosts highest stat by 1 stage upon entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Majestic Moth automatically raises the Pokemon's highest calculated stat by 1 stage when it enters battle. The ability analyzes all five battle stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) including current stat stage modifiers, then boosts whichever stat is highest.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Overview
Majestic Moth is an entry-triggered ability that automatically boosts the Pokemon's highest calculated stat by one stage when it enters battle. This ability provides immediate value by enhancing the Pokemon's strongest attribute.

### Mechanics

### Core Functionality
- **Trigger**: Activates when the Pokemon enters battle (switching in or battle start)
- **Effect**: Raises the highest calculated stat by +1 stage
- **Stat Analysis**: Considers all five battle stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
- **Calculation**: Includes current stat stage modifiers when determining the highest stat

### Implementation Details
```cpp
constexpr Ability MajesticMoth = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE), MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER, NULL))
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_AttackerAbilityStatRaiseEnd3);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Stat Determination Process
1. **Stat Calculation**: Uses `GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE)` with `includeStatStages = TRUE`
2. **Current Values**: Considers base stats + current stat stage modifiers
3. **Stage Multipliers**: Factors in stage boosts/drops using `gStatStageRatios`
4. **Selection**: Chooses the stat with the highest final calculated value
5. **Boost Application**: Applies +1 stage boost to the selected stat

### Important Notes
- The ability considers **current** stat stages when determining the highest stat
- If a Pokemon has +2 Attack stages but higher base Special Attack, it will boost whichever has the higher calculated total
- The boost is applied immediately upon entry, before any other entry effects
- Cannot boost HP (only the five battle stats are considered)

## Pokemon with Majestic Moth

### Primary Users (Innate Ability)
- **Venomoth line**: Offensive moth Pokemon that benefit from boosting their highest attacking stat
- **Volcarona variants**: Powerful special attackers that typically boost Special Attack
- **Dustox line**: Defensive moths that may boost Defense or Special Defense
- **Frosmoth line**: Ice-type moths with varied stat distributions
- **Paradox Moths**: Future/past variants with unique stat spreads

### Usage Patterns
- Most moths have high Special Attack, so they typically boost Special Attack
- Defensive variants may boost Defense or Special Defense depending on their spread
- Speed-oriented builds may boost Speed if it's their highest calculated stat

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- **Immediate Value**: Provides an instant +1 boost without setup
- **Adaptive**: Boosts the most relevant stat for each individual Pokemon
- **Stacking**: Can work with existing stat boosts to determine the best stat to enhance
- **Reliability**: Always activates on entry, no conditions required

### Strategic Applications
- **Sweeper Support**: Enhances offensive stats for immediate pressure
- **Defensive Pivoting**: Boosts defensive stats when switching into threats
- **Speed Control**: Can boost Speed for faster Pokemon to maintain priority
- **Stat Stage Synergy**: Works well with moves that provide additional stat boosts

### Limitations
- **One-Time Effect**: Only activates on entry, not repeatedly
- **Predictable**: Opponents can anticipate which stat will be boosted
- **Stage Dependency**: Less effective if the Pokemon already has high stat stages
- **No HP Boost**: Cannot improve overall bulk through HP increases

## Interactions and Synergies

### Positive Interactions
- **Baton Pass**: Can pass the boosted stat to teammates
- **Stat Boost Moves**: Stacks with self-boosting moves for greater effect
- **Choice Items**: Provides initial boost before Choice item lock-in
- **Weak Armor/Stamina**: Can benefit from defensive stat boosts before taking damage

### Potential Conflicts
- **Clear Smog/Haze**: Stat boosts can be reset by these moves
- **Intimidate**: May alter Attack calculations before Majestic Moth triggers
- **Contrary**: Would lower the highest stat instead of raising it

## Optimal Usage

### Team Building
- **Stat Spreads**: Design EV spreads to influence which stat gets boosted
- **Move Synergy**: Pair with moves that benefit from the likely boosted stat
- **Entry Timing**: Switch in at optimal moments to maximize the boost's impact
- **Role Definition**: Clear offensive or defensive role helps predict boost target

### Prediction and Counterplay
- **Stat Analysis**: Opponents can predict which stat will be boosted by examining the Pokemon's stats
- **Timing Awareness**: Entry timing becomes crucial for both user and opponent
- **Stat Reset Moves**: Clear Smog, Haze, or Roar can remove the boost
- **Phazing**: Forcing switches can waste the entry boost

## Technical Implementation

### Function Flow
1. `OnEntry` trigger activates when Pokemon enters battle
2. `GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE)` determines which stat to boost
3. `ChangeStatBuffs` applies the +1 stage increase
4. Battle script displays the stat boost message
5. Effect completes and battle continues

### Error Handling
- Uses `CHECK` macro to ensure stat boost is possible
- Fails gracefully if stat cannot be boosted (e.g., already at +6)
- Proper battle script integration for visual feedback

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal computational overhead
- Single function call for stat determination
- Standard stat boost mechanics integration
