# Breezy Neigh - Ability ID 858

## In-Game Description
KOs raise Speed by one stage.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When this Pokemon knocks out an opponent with a direct attack, its Speed stat increases by one stage. This boost occurs immediately after the target faints, potentially allowing the user to outspeed previously faster opponents. The effect activates only when the Pokemon with this ability directly causes a knockout through damage.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Technical Implementation

**File**: `src/abilities.cc`
**Mechanism**: Uses the `MoxieClone` function with `STAT_SPEED` parameter
**Trigger**: `onBattlerFaints` with `APPLY_ON_ATTACKER`

```cpp
constexpr Ability BreezyNeigh = {
    .onBattlerFaints = AdrenalineRush.onBattlerFaints,
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ATTACKER,
};

constexpr Ability AdrenalineRush = {
    .onBattlerFaints = +[](ON_BATTLER_FAINTS) -> int { return MoxieClone(battler, STAT_SPEED); },
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ATTACKER,
};
```

## Key Mechanics

1. **Activation Condition**: Only activates when the Pokemon with Breezy Neigh directly causes a knockout
2. **Stat Boost**: Raises Speed by exactly one stage (+50% of base Speed stat)
3. **Timing**: Speed boost occurs immediately after the target faints
4. **Stacking**: Multiple knockouts result in multiple Speed boosts (up to +6 stages maximum)
5. **Battle Script**: Uses `BattleScript_RaiseStatOnFaintingTarget` for the animation and message

## Battle Applications
- Excellent for sweeping teams after securing the first knockout
- Synergizes well with Choice Scarf or other speed-boosting items
- Particularly effective on Pokemon with good offensive stats but moderate base Speed
- Can turn slow, powerful attackers into late-game threats
