# Emergency Exit - Ability ID 194

## In-Game Description
"At 1/2 of max HP or below, instantly switches out."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When this Pokemon's HP drops to half or below from an attack, it automatically switches out at the end of the turn in trainer battles only. Requires usable party members and cannot be prevented by trapping effects. The switching occurs after all move effects resolve completely safely.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Implementation Details
Emergency Exit is implemented identically to Wimp Out - they share the same `onDefender` function that:

1. **Trigger Check**: `CheckHalfHpAbility(battler, attacker)` verifies:
   - Pokemon was above 50% HP before the attack
   - Pokemon is now at or below 50% HP after the attack
   - Not during multi-hit moves (only triggers on final hit)

2. **Battle Context Checks**:
   - Must be a trainer battle (`BATTLE_TYPE_TRAINER`)
   - Cannot be Arena battle format
   - Must have usable party members available
   - Must be able to switch (not trapped)

3. **Activation**: Sets `RESOURCE_FLAG_EMERGENCY_EXIT` flag for processing during move end phase

### Activation Conditions
- **HP Threshold**: Exactly 50% max HP or below
- **Damage Source**: Must be from an opponent's attack
- **Battle Type**: Trainer battles only (not wild battles)
- **Party Status**: Must have switchable Pokemon available
- **Timing**: Only on the final hit of multi-hit moves
- **Status**: Cannot be prevented by trapping moves/abilities

### Priority and Interactions
- **When**: After damage calculation, during move end effects
- **Priority**: Processed in `MOVEEND_EMERGENCY_EXIT` phase
- **Sheer Force**: Blocked by Sheer Force on the attacking move
- **Multi-hit**: Only triggers after the final hit connects
- **Trapping**: Blocked by abilities like Arena Trap or moves like Mean Look

### Strategic Applications

**Defensive Utility**:
- **Damage Pivot**: Safely exit after taking significant damage
- **Status Avoidance**: Escape before secondary effects apply
- **Momentum Control**: Force switches at crucial moments
- **Team Preview**: Reveals when opponent reaches damage thresholds

**Offensive Applications**:
- **Hit-and-Run**: Attack then automatically switch out
- **Surprise Factor**: Unexpected switches can disrupt opponent's strategy
- **Entry Hazard Setup**: Switch to hazard setters after triggering

**Synergistic Combinations**:
- **Regenerator**: Heal while switched out
- **U-turn/Volt Switch**: Manual switching before the threshold
- **Focus Sash**: Survive to exactly 1 HP and trigger
- **Healing Items**: Sitrus Berry can interfere with timing

### Pokemon Distribution
Found on several Pokemon as both regular and innate abilities:
- Speed-oriented Pokemon (Deoxys forms)
- Defensive support Pokemon (Audino variants)
- Mixed offensive/defensive roles

### Battle Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Damage Threshold**
- Pokemon at 60% HP takes 25% damage to Triggers (now at 35%)
- Pokemon at 45% HP takes damage to Does not trigger (already below threshold)

**Scenario 2: Multi-hit Moves**
- Double Kick: First hit brings to 45%, second hit to 20% to Triggers after second hit
- Triple Kick: Only checks after final hit regardless of intermediate HP

**Scenario 3: Battle Format**
- Trainer Battle: Functions normally
- Wild Battle: Does not activate
- Arena Battle: Blocked entirely

### Counterplay Strategies
- **Trapping**: Use Arena Trap, Shadow Tag, or Mean Look
- **Sheer Force**: Abilities that add Sheer Force prevent activation
- **Exact Damage**: Calculate to avoid triggering the threshold
- **Status Effects**: Apply before reaching 50% HP threshold
- **Multi-hit Moves**: Only the final hit matters for activation

## Mechanical Differences from Similar Abilities
- **Wimp Out**: Identical functionality (same code implementation)
- **Eject Button**: Item-based, single use, any damage threshold
- **Red Card**: Triggered when hit by contact moves specifically
- **Teleport**: Manual switching move, not automatic

## Coding Notes
- Uses shared `CheckHalfHpAbility` function with other half-HP triggered abilities
- Flag-based delayed activation system prevents mid-battle conflicts
- Battle script handles both trainer and wild battle contexts separately
- No ability state tracking needed (stateless activation)
