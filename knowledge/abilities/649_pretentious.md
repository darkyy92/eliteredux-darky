# Pretentious - Ability ID 649

## In-Game Description
Dealing a KO raises Crit by one stage.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

This arrogant ability manifests when the Pokemon defeats an opponent, boosting its critical hit ratio by one stage as a display of superiority. Each knockout makes the Pokemon more likely to land devastating critical hits in subsequent battles, reflecting growing overconfidence and disdain.
