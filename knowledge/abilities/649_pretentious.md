# Pretentious

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*
Dealing a KO raises Crit by one stage.

## Extended In-Game Description
This arrogant ability manifests when the Pokémon defeats an opponent, boosting its critical hit ratio by one stage as a display of superiority. Each knockout makes the Pokémon more likely to land devastating critical hits in subsequent battles, reflecting growing overconfidence and disdain.
