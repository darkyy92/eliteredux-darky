## Basic Description
Dealing a KO raises Crit by one stage.

## Extended Description
This arrogant ability manifests when the Pokémon defeats an opponent, boosting its critical hit ratio by one stage as a display of superiority. Each knockout makes the Pokémon more likely to land devastating critical hits in subsequent battles, reflecting growing overconfidence and disdain.
