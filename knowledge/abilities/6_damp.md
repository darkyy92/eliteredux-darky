# Damp - Ability ID 6

## In-Game Description
"Makes the target become Water-type on contact. Also works on offense."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Contact moves from or against this Pokémon soak the opponent, changing their type to pure Water. This type change removes their STAB bonuses and alters their weaknesses and resistances.

*Character count: 190*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Damp has been completely reimagined in Elite Redux as an aggressive type-changing ability:

1. **Type Change Mechanic**
   - Triggers on any contact move (offensive or defensive)
   - Changes the opponent to pure Water-type
   - Sets both type1 and type2 to Water
   - Sets type3 to Mystery type
   - Permanent until switched out or changed again

2. **Activation Conditions**
   - Either the attacker or defender must have Damp
   - The move must make contact
   - Standard on-hit effect conditions apply
   - Target must not already be Water-type

### Technical Implementation

**Code Implementation** (`src/abilities.cc`):
```cpp
ON_EITHER(Damp) {
    CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(opponent))
    CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, gBattlerAttacker))
    CHECK_NOT(IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE(opponent, TYPE_WATER))
    
    gBattleMons[opponent].type1 = TYPE_WATER;
    gBattleMons[opponent].type2 = TYPE_WATER;
    gBattleMons[opponent].type3 = TYPE_MYSTERY;
    
    PREPARE_TYPE_BUFFER(gBattleTextBuff1, TYPE_WATER);
    gStackBattler1 = opponent;
    BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_StackBecameTheTypeFull);
    return TRUE;
}
```

### Complete Rework from Vanilla
**Original Damp**: Prevented Self-Destruct, Explosion, Mind Blown, and Misty Explosion
**Elite Redux Damp**: Forces type change to Water on contact

This represents a complete philosophical shift from a defensive/preventative ability to an aggressive type-manipulation ability.

### Strategic Implications

1. **Offensive Benefits**
   - Remove opponent's STAB moves
   - Force Water-type weaknesses (Electric, Grass)
   - Eliminate problematic type immunities (Ground to Electric, etc.)
   - Set up for super effective follow-up attacks

2. **Defensive Benefits**
   - Neutralize Fighting, Fire, Rock effectiveness
   - Remove dangerous STAB attacks from opponent
   - Predictable defensive typing for calculations

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Protean/Libero**: Type changes after, potentially overwriting
- **Color Change**: Would change Damp user's type to Water if hit
- **Soak move**: Essentially gives Soak effect on contact
- **Type-based abilities**: May activate/deactivate based on new typing
- **Weather**: Makes opponent vulnerable to rain-boosted Water moves

### Example Battle Scenarios

**Scenario 1 - Offensive**:
- Damp user uses Close Combat on Garchomp
- Garchomp becomes Water-type, loses Dragon/Ground STAB
- Now weak to teammate's Thunderbolt

**Scenario 2 - Defensive**:
- Blaziken uses Blaze Kick on Damp user
- Blaziken becomes Water-type, loses Fire/Fighting STAB
- Future Fire attacks deal reduced damage

### Common Users
The reimagined Damp would logically appear on:
- Water-type Pokémon with "soaking" themes
- Pokémon with aquatic or amphibious characteristics
- Potentially some Poison-types (dampening opponents)

### Competitive Usage Notes
- S-tier disruption ability
- Counters setup sweepers by removing STAB
- Enables Electric/Grass coverage to be more valuable
- Can neutralize type-based strategies
- Particularly strong on fast physical attackers

### Counters
- **Non-contact moves**: Special attackers avoid the effect
- **Long-range physical moves**: Earthquake, Rock Slide, etc.
- **Pivot moves**: U-turn/Volt Switch to reset typing
- **Water-types**: Immune to the type change
- **Type-reset moves**: Could potentially restore original typing

### Synergies
- **Electric/Grass coverage**: Exploit new Water weakness
- **Contact spam**: Multiple chances to trigger
- **Fake Out leads**: Guaranteed type change turn 1
- **Pursuit trappers**: Punish forced switches
- **Weather teams**: Rain boosts Water moves against new Water-types

### Version History
- **Original Games**: Prevented explosion moves
- **Elite Redux**: Complete rework into type-changing ability
