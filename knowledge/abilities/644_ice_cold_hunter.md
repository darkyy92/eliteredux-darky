*Character count: 291*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation (Discord/Reference)

Ice Cold Hunter is an extremely powerful weather-based ability that transforms the user into a devastating Ice-type attacker during hail weather. When active, it makes ANY single-hit Ice-type move hit twice at FULL POWER - this is crucial because unlike regular Parental Bond (which reduces the second hit to 25% damage), Ice Cold Hunter delivers 100% damage on BOTH hits. This effectively DOUBLES your Ice-type damage output in hail.

Additionally, Pokemon with this ability are completely immune to hail damage, allowing them to stay in battle indefinitely during hailstorms without taking passive weather damage.

## Trigger Conditions

The double-hit effect activates when ALL of the following conditions are met:
- The user is using an Ice-type move
- The user is affected by hail weather (not nullified by abilities like Air Lock)
- The move is a single-hit move (doesn't stack with moves that already hit multiple times like Icicle Spear)

## Numerical Effects

- **Hit Count**: Ice-type moves hit exactly 2 times
- **Damage Per Hit**: 100% damage on BOTH hits (no reduction unlike Parental Bond)
- **Total Damage Output**: 200% of normal damage (literally doubles Ice-type damage)
- **Hail Immunity**: User takes 0 damage from hail weather each turn
- **Critical Hit Chance**: Each hit rolls for critical independently
- **Secondary Effect Chance**: Each hit can trigger secondary effects (like freeze chance) independently

## Interactions

- **Weather**: Only activates during hail weather conditions
- **Move Types**: Only affects moves with Ice typing
- **Multi-hit Moves**: Does not stack with moves that already hit multiple times
- **Parental Bond System**: Uses the same multi-hit framework as Parental Bond
- **Move Effects**: Each hit can trigger secondary effects independently

## Special Cases

- The ability uses the Parental Bond framework but is NOT affected by items or abilities that modify Parental Bond
- Both hits are affected by type effectiveness calculations
- Critical hit chance is calculated independently for each hit
- Status effect chances apply to each hit separately

## Notes

- This ability essentially turns any Ice-type move into a 2-hit move during hail, making it extremely powerful for Ice-type attackers
- The hail immunity is a passive benefit that's always active, regardless of whether the Pokemon is using Ice-type moves
- Synergizes perfectly with hail-setting moves or abilities
