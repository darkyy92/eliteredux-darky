# Showdown Mode - Ability ID 542

## In-Game Description
"Ambush + Violent Rush."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Showdown Mode combines the devastating effects of Ambush and Violent Rush on the first turn after switching in. The Pokemon gains guaranteed critical hits on all attacks plus boosts Attack by 20% and Speed by 50% for explosive opening turns that can catch opponents off guard.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Showdown Mode is a combination ability that merges two powerful first-turn abilities:

**Ambush Component:**
- Guarantees critical hits on all moves during the first turn after switching in
- Critical hits ignore defensive stat boosts and deal 1.5x damage

**Violent Rush Component:**
- Boosts Attack stat by 20% (multiplier of 6/5 = 1.2x) on the first turn
- Boosts Speed by 50% (multiplier of 150/100 = 1.5x) on the first turn

### Activation Conditions
- Triggers automatically upon switching into battle
- Effects only last for the first turn after switch-in
- Both volatile flags (`showdownMode` and `violentRush`) are set simultaneously
- The ability announces itself with a switch-in message

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability ShowdownMode = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        gVolatileStructs[battler].showdownMode = gVolatileStructs[battler].started.showdownMode = TRUE;
        return SwitchInAnnounce(B_MSG_SWITCHIN_SHOWDOWN_MODE);
    },
};
```

**Critical Hit Logic:**
```c
// In battle_script_commands.c - Always Critical section
if (gVolatileStructs[battlerAtk].showdownMode) {
    return ALWAYS_CRIT;
}
```

**Attack Boost:**
```c
// In battle_util.c - Attack stat calculation
if (gVolatileStructs[battler].showdownMode) statBase = statBase * 6 / 5; // +20%
```

**Speed Boost:**
```c
// In battle_main.c - Speed calculation
if (gVolatileStructs[battlerId].showdownMode) speed = (speed * 150) / 100; // +50%
```

**Turn Cleanup:**
```c
// Effects are cleared after the first turn unless battler was just switched in
CLEAR_ONE_TURN(showdownMode)
CLEAR_ONE_TURN(violentRush)
```

### Numerical Values
- **Attack Boost:** +20% (1.2x multiplier)
- **Speed Boost:** +50% (1.5x multiplier)  
- **Critical Hit Rate:** 100% (guaranteed on all moves)
- **Duration:** First turn only after switch-in

### Affected Moves
- **Critical Hits:** All offensive moves that can normally crit
- **Attack Boost:** All physical moves benefit from the Attack increase
- **Speed Boost:** Affects turn order and speed-based calculations

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Stacks with other stat boosts:** The 20% Attack boost applies before other multipliers
- **Speed boost affects turn order:** Can allow slower Pokemon to outspeed opponents
- **Critical hits bypass defensive boosts:** Ignores opponent's Defense/Special Defense stat increases
- **Works with held items:** Scope Lens, Lucky Punch, etc. are redundant for crit rate but may still provide other benefits
- **Compatible with move effects:** Works with high-crit moves, but they're already guaranteed to crit

### Strategic Implications
- **Wallbreaker Role:** Guaranteed crits ignore defensive setups like Reflect/Light Screen effects on damage calculation
- **Revenge Killer:** Speed boost allows revenge killing faster threats
- **Lead Potential:** Devastating opening turn can force immediate switches
- **Momentum Control:** Can break through defensive cores with guaranteed critical damage

### Example Damage Calculations
**Scenario:** Level 50 Pokemon with 252 Attack EVs using a 100 Base Power move

**Without Showdown Mode:**
- Base Attack: ~200
- Move Power: 100
- Damage: ~Normal damage calculation

**With Showdown Mode:**
- Base Attack: ~240 (200 x 1.2)
- Move Power: 100
- Critical Hit: 1.5x damage multiplier
- **Total effective multiplier:** 1.8x normal damage (1.2 x 1.5)

### Common Users
Pokemon that benefit most from Showdown Mode typically:
- Have high base Attack stats to maximize the boost
- Appreciate the speed control for revenge killing
- Want to break through defensive teams quickly
- Need help with immediate offensive presence

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Priority:** Extremely high in offensive team compositions
- **Timing:** Best used as a switch-in against predicted defensive plays
- **Synergy:** Pairs well with Choice items for continued pressure after the first turn
- **Terrain/Weather:** Speed boost can help set up beneficial field conditions

### Counters
- **Ghost-types:** Immune to Normal/Fighting moves that rely on the Attack boost
- **Intimidate:** Can partially offset the Attack boost (-1 stage vs +20% base)
- **Priority Moves:** Can bypass the speed advantage entirely
- **Protect/Detect:** Forces the ability to waste its one-turn window
- **Defensive typing:** Steel/Rock types can still tank even boosted critical hits

### Synergies
- **Choice Band/Specs:** Extends offensive pressure beyond the first turn
- **Life Orb:** Stacks with the Attack boost for maximum damage
- **High base power moves:** Maximizes the critical hit damage
- **Coverage moves:** Ensures super-effective hits with guaranteed crits

### Version History
- Introduced as a combination ability merging Ambush (guaranteed first-turn crits) and Violent Rush (first-turn Attack/Speed boosts)
- Part of Elite Redux's expanded ability system
- Designed to create explosive opening turns for offensive Pokemon
