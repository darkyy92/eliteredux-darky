# Frostmaw

**Effect**: Biting moves have a 50% chance to inflict frostbite.

When this Pokémon uses a biting move like Bite, Crunch, or any Fang attack, there's a 50% chance the target will be inflicted with frostbite. Frostbitten Pokémon lose 1/16 of their maximum HP each turn and suffer a 50% reduction to their Special Attack stat until cured.
