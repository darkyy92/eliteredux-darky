## In-Game Description
"30% chance to inflict Fear status on contact."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

This intimidating ability causes fear in opponents through both offensive and defensive contact situations. When the Pokemon makes or receives contact moves, there's a 30% chance to inflict the Fear status condition on the opposing Pokemon, effectively preventing them from switching out.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Menacing Situation is a contact-based ability that creates battlefield control through fear, making it dangerous for opponents to engage in physical combat.

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger Conditions**: Both making and receiving contact moves
- **Activation Rate**: 30% chance per contact
- **Status Effect**: Fear (prevents switching out)
- **Duration**: Persistent until switch-out or cure

### Contact Interactions
- **Offensive Contact**: When the user makes contact moves
- **Defensive Contact**: When opponents hit the user with contact moves
- **Dual Activation**: Can trigger on both attacking and defending
- **Contact Independence**: Only works with moves that make physical contact

### Fear Status Effect
- **Switch Prevention**: Affected Pokemon cannot switch out voluntarily
- **Move Restriction**: Does not prevent move usage
- **Escape Moves**: May be blocked or have reduced effectiveness
- **Duration**: Lasts until the affected Pokemon switches or is cured

### Strategic Applications
- **Trapping Utility**: Forces opponents to stay in unfavorable matchups
- **Contact Deterrent**: Discourages physical attackers from making contact
- **Setup Enabler**: Allows safe setup when opponents are trapped
- **Momentum Control**: Prevents defensive switching strategies

### Notable Interactions
- **Multi-Hit Moves**: Each hit can trigger fear independently
- **Substitute**: May block the fear effect if behind substitute
- **Ghost Types**: May have different interactions with fear effects
