# Multitype

## Overview
Multitype is an exclusive ability that allows the holder to change their type based on the held Plate item. This ability is unsuppressable and cannot be randomized, ensuring it remains a defining trait of specific Pokémon.

## In-Game Description
"Held Plate item decides holder's type."

## Detailed Mechanics

### Type Change Mechanism
- The holder's type changes to match the type of the held Plate item
- For example: holding a Flame Plate changes the holder to Fire-type
- Without a Plate, the holder remains their base type (typically Normal)
- The type change is permanent while holding the Plate

### Plate Items and Corresponding Types
- **Flame Plate**: Fire-type
- **Splash Plate**: Water-type
- **Zap Plate**: Electric-type
- **Meadow Plate**: Grass-type
- **Icicle Plate**: Ice-type
- **Fist Plate**: Fighting-type
- **Toxic Plate**: Poison-type
- **Earth Plate**: Ground-type
- **Sky Plate**: Flying-type
- **Mind Plate**: Psychic-type
- **Insect Plate**: Bug-type
- **Stone Plate**: Rock-type
- **Spooky Plate**: Ghost-type
- **Draco Plate**: Dragon-type
- **Dread Plate**: Dark-type
- **Iron Plate**: Steel-type
- **Pixie Plate**: Fairy-type

### Special Properties
- **Unsuppressable**: Cannot be negated by abilities like Mold Breaker or moves like Gastro Acid
- **Randomizer Banned**: Cannot be randomly assigned in randomizer modes
- **Item Lock**: Plates cannot be removed from Arceus by moves like Knock Off or Trick

### Battle Interactions
- Type changes affect:
  - STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) calculations
  - Type effectiveness for both offense and defense
  - Moves that depend on the user's type (e.g., Judgment)
- The type change happens immediately upon gaining/losing a Plate
- Works in conjunction with type-boosting effects of Plates (20% boost to matching type moves)

## Usage Tips
- Primarily used by Arceus to access different forms
- Each form has the same base stats but different typing
- Strategic plate switching can provide type advantages
- Plates serve dual purpose: type change + 20% damage boost

## Known Users
- Arceus (all forms)

## Extended In-Game Description
Multitype revolutionizes type flexibility by linking the holder's type directly to held Plate items. Holding a Flame Plate transforms the user to Fire-type, while Splash Plate grants Water-type. This unsuppressable ability ensures consistent type-changing mechanics that define legendary encounters.
