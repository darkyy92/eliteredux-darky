# Multitype - Ability ID 121

## In-Game Description
"Held Plate item decides holder's type."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Multitype revolutionizes type flexibility by linking the holder's type directly to held Plate items. Holding a Flame Plate transforms the user to Fire-type, while Splash Plate grants Water-type. This unsuppressable ability ensures consistent type-changing mechanics that define legendary encounters.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Type Change Mechanism
- The holder's type changes to match the type of the held Plate item
- For example: holding a Flame Plate changes the holder to Fire-type
- Without a Plate, the holder remains their base type (typically Normal)
- The type change is permanent while holding the Plate

### Plate Items and Corresponding Types

- **Splash Plate**: Water-type
- **Zap Plate**: Electric-type
- **Meadow Plate**: Grass-type

- **Stone Plate**: Rock-type
- **Spooky Plate**: Ghost-type
- **Draco Plate**: Dragon-type
- **Dread Plate**: Dark-type

- **Pixie Plate**: Fairy-type

### Special Properties
- **Unsuppressable**: Cannot be negated by abilities like Mold Breaker or moves like Gastro Acid
- **Randomizer Banned**: Cannot be randomly assigned in randomizer modes
- **Item Lock**: Plates cannot be removed from Arceus by moves like Knock Off or Trick

### Battle Interactions
- Type changes affect:
  - STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) calculations
  - Type effectiveness for both offense and defense
  - Moves that depend on the user's type (e.g., Judgment)
- The type change happens immediately upon gaining/losing a Plate
- Works in conjunction with type-boosting effects of Plates (20% boost to matching type moves)

## Usage Tips
- Primarily used by Arceus to access different forms
- Each form has the same base stats but different typing
- Strategic plate switching can provide type advantages
- Plates serve dual purpose: type change + 20% damage boost

## Known Users
