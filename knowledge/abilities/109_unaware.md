# Unaware - Ability ID 109

## In-Game Description
"Ignores foes' stat changes, both positive and negative ones."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Unaware ignores all opponent stat changes when calculating damage, treating their stats as if they have no boosts or drops. This allows the user to deal consistent damage against setup sweepers like Dragon Dance users and ignore defensive boosts, while also being unaffected by opponent stat debuffs.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**UNAWARE** is a stat-ignoring ability that treats opponent Pokemon as having neutral stat stages when calculating damage.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Function**: Forces all opponent stat calculations to use stage 6 (neutral) instead of actual stat stages
- **Direction**: Only ignores opponent's stat changes; user's own stat changes work normally
- **Scope**: Affects all stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) when relevant to damage calculation

### Activation Conditions:
1. **As Attacker**: Ignores target's defensive stat changes (Defense/Special Defense)
2. **As Defender**: Ignores attacker's offensive stat changes (Attack/Special Attack)
3. **Special Moves**: Works with Foul Play (ignores user's own Attack changes), Body Press, etc.

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability Unaware = {
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .unaware = TRUE,
};

// In CalculateStat function:
if (isUnaware)
    statStage = DEFAULT_STAT_STAGE; // Sets to stage 6 (neutral)
```

### Stat Stage System:
- **Stage Range**: -6 to +6 (stages 0-12 internally)
- **Neutral Stage**: 6 (DEFAULT_STAT_STAGE)
- **Multipliers**: Stage 0 = 25% stats, Stage 6 = 100% stats, Stage 12 = 400% stats
- **Unaware Effect**: Forces calculation to always use stage 6 multiplier (1.0x)

### What Unaware Ignores:
- **Stat Boosts**: Swords Dance (+2 Attack), Calm Mind (+1 SpA/SpD), Shell Smash, etc.
- **Stat Drops**: Intimidate (-1 Attack), Overheat (-2 SpA), Hammer Arm (-1 Speed), etc.
- **Ability-Based Changes**: Simple (doubles stat changes), Contrary (reverses changes)
- **Item Effects**: Eviolite defensive boosts are NOT ignored (permanent stat modification)
- **Status Effects**: Burn's Attack reduction is NOT ignored (affects base stat, not stages)

### What Unaware Does NOT Ignore:
- **User's Own Stats**: User's stat changes work normally
- **Base Stats**: Natural stat differences between species
- **Items**: Choice Band, Life Orb, Eviolite effects
- **Status Conditions**: Burn, paralysis, frostbite effects on base stats
- **Abilities**: Wonder Room, Huge Power effects on base stats
- **Critical Hits**: Still get damage boost and ignore positive defensive changes normally

### Move Interactions:
1. **Foul Play**: Uses target's Attack stat but with Unaware user ignoring the target's Attack boosts
2. **Body Press**: Uses user's Defense stat, unaffected by Unaware when used by Unaware Pokemon
3. **Power Trip/Stored Power**: Damage calculation ignores target's stat changes when hit by Unaware Pokemon
4. **Psyshock**: Targets Defense, so Unaware ignores target's Defense changes

### Ability Interactions:
- **Competitive/Defiant**: These abilities DO NOT trigger when stats are ignored by Unaware
- **Simple**: Doubled stat changes are ignored by Unaware (treated as neutral)
- **Contrary**: Reversed stat changes are ignored by Unaware
- **Mold Breaker**: Cannot bypass Unaware (not a protective ability)

### Strategic Applications:
1. **Anti-Setup**: Counters sweepers who rely on stat boosts (Dragon Dance, Quiver Dance users)
2. **Consistent Damage**: Deals predictable damage regardless of opponent's stat manipulation
3. **Defensive Utility**: Ignores Attack drops from Intimidate or opponent's stat boosts
4. **Late Game**: Remains effective even after opponent has accumulated multiple stat changes

### Example Damage Calculations:
**Scenario**: Unaware Pokemon vs +6 Attack Adamant Garchomp using Earthquake
- **Normal Calculation**: 394 Attack * 4.0 (stage +6) = 1,576 effective Attack
- **With Unaware**: 394 Attack * 1.0 (stage 6 neutral) = 394 effective Attack
- **Result**: ~75% damage reduction from ignoring the +6 Attack boost

### Common Users:
- **Wobbuffet/Wynaut**: Tank setup sweepers with Shadow Tag
- **Quagsire**: Combines with good bulk and Water/Ground typing
- **Clefable**: Versatile support with Magic Guard and good stats
- **Pyukumuku**: Extreme special bulk with Unaware for physical attackers
- **Bibarel**: Simple Normal-type with decent bulk

### Competitive Utility:
- **Tier Placement**: Often OU/UU viable purely due to Unaware utility
- **Team Role**: Dedicated wall against physical/special setup sweepers
- **Item Synergy**: Leftovers for longevity, Rocky Helmet for chip damage
- **Move Synergy**: Haze/Clear Smog to remove stat changes, recovery moves

### Counters and Limitations:
1. **Critical Hits**: Still get increased damage and ignore positive defensive stat changes
2. **Multi-hit Moves**: Each hit benefits from Unaware separately
3. **Status Moves**: Doesn't protect against non-damaging moves
4. **Base Power Scaling**: Doesn't help against naturally powerful moves
5. **Type Effectiveness**: Still takes normal super effective damage

### Synergies:
- **Haze/Clear Smog**: Remove stat changes that Unaware would ignore anyway
- **Toxic Spikes**: Support move that benefits from Unaware's defensive utility
- **Stealth Rock**: Entry hazard support while walling setup attempts
- **Recover/Roost**: Essential for maintaining HP while checking setup sweepers

### Version History:
- **Generation 4**: Introduced with Bidoof line
- **Generation 5+**: Mechanics refined, became more competitively relevant
- **Elite Redux**: Functions identically to main series implementation
