# Doombringer - Ability ID 495

## In-Game Description
"Uses Doom Desire on switch-in."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Upon entering battle, automatically uses Doom Desire against an opponent. This Steel-type delayed attack has 140 base power and strikes the target exactly two turns later, bypassing substitutes and other protections. The attack cannot miss once initiated and ignores accuracy checks.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Doombringer automatically initiates a devastating delayed attack when entering battle, creating inevitable future damage that cannot be easily avoided or blocked.

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Activates immediately upon switching into battle
- **Target**: Automatically targets the first available opposing Pokemon
- **Move used**: Doom Desire (Steel-type, 140 base power)
- **Delay**: Attack lands exactly 2 turns after activation
- **Guarantee**: Cannot miss once the countdown begins

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability Doombringer = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int { 
        return UseEntryMove(battler, ability, MOVE_DOOM_DESIRE, 0); 
    },
};
```

### Doom Desire Move Properties
- **Type**: Steel
- **Category**: Special
- **Base Power**: 140
- **Accuracy**: 100% (but irrelevant after activation)
- **Effect**: EFFECT_FUTURE_SIGHT (delayed attack)
- **Target**: Selected opponent
- **PP**: 5 (not relevant for ability usage)

### Future Sight Mechanics
- **Turn 1**: Doom Desire is activated, target is marked
- **Turn 2**: Countdown continues, no damage
- **Turn 3**: Doom Desire hits the originally targeted position
- **Persistence**: Attack lands even if user faints or switches out
- **Inevitability**: Cannot be stopped once countdown starts

### Strategic Applications
- **Entry pressure**: Immediate threat upon switching in
- **Delayed punishment**: Forces opponent into difficult positions
- **Switch-in safety**: Threatens revenge even if user is KO'd
- **Field control**: Creates ongoing battlefield pressure
- **Steel coverage**: Provides Steel-type attacks for non-Steel users

### Defensive Interactions
**Cannot be blocked by:**
- Protect/Detect (delayed attacks bypass protection)
- Substitute (Future Sight effect ignores substitutes)
- Switching out (attack follows the battlefield position)
- Type immunity (Steel-type interactions still apply)

**Can be avoided by:**
- Switching the targeted Pokemon out (if done before attack lands)
- Wonder Guard (if Steel isn't super-effective)
- Magic Guard (prevents Future Sight damage)

### Timing Considerations
- **Switch-in Turn**: Doom Desire activates
- **Opponent Turn 1**: Can react/switch with 2 turns of warning
- **User Turn 2**: Can follow up or switch out safely
- **Opponent Turn 2**: Last chance to avoid by switching
- **Turn 3**: Doom Desire hits regardless of user status

### Double Battle Applications
- **Position targeting**: Targets specific battlefield position
- **Ally protection**: Attack can hit even if user is KO'd
- **Field pressure**: Forces opponent positioning decisions
- **Steel coverage**: Provides team Steel-type damage

### Competitive Usage
- **Entry hazard**: Creates immediate battlefield pressure
- **Revenge tool**: Guarantees damage even if user faints
- **Steel utility**: Non-Steel types gain powerful Steel attack
- **Prediction tool**: Forces opponent into suboptimal plays
- **Late-game finisher**: High power delayed damage

### Synergies
**Team support:**
- Entry hazards: Stack damage with Stealth Rock/Spikes
- Pivot moves: U-turn/Volt Switch after setting up doom
- Taunt users: Prevent defensive moves before doom hits
- Trappers: Prevent switching to avoid the delayed attack

**Item synergies:**
- Choice items: Can lock into setup then switch
- Leftovers: Sustain while doom countdown proceeds
- Focus Sash: Survive to ensure doom activation

### Counters
- **Fast KO**: Eliminate user before they can switch
- **Strategic switching**: Move targeted Pokemon to safety
- **Magic Guard**: Prevents Future Sight damage entirely
- **Wonder Guard**: If Steel isn't super-effective
- **Pressure**: Quickly eliminate to prevent follow-up

### Limitations
- **One activation**: Only triggers once per switch-in
- **Delayed damage**: No immediate impact
- **Switch dependency**: Opponent can avoid by switching
- **Predictable**: Opponent knows doom is coming
- **Position-based**: Targets battlefield position, not specific Pokemon

### Version History
- Elite Redux custom ability for delayed battlefield control
- Based on Jirachi's signature move Doom Desire
- Designed to create inevitable pressure and strategic depth
- Part of expanded entry ability system
