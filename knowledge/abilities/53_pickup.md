# Pickup - Ability ID 53

## In-Game Description
"Removes all hazards on entry. Not immune to hazards."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Pickup automatically clears all entry hazards from your side of the field when entering battle. Removes Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, Hot Coals, and Caltrops. The Pokémon still takes full hazard damage on entry before clearing, but provides immediate field support for the team.

*Character count: 285*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**PICKUP** is a hazard-clearing ability that removes all entry hazards from the user's side of the field upon switch-in, though it does not provide immunity to the hazards themselves.

### Activation Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: Immediately upon entering battle (onEntry hook)
- **Timing**: Activates after taking hazard damage (no immunity)
- **Scope**: Clears all hazards on user's side only
- **Script**: Displays "{Pokémon} removed hazards on its field side!"

### Hazards Cleared:
1. **Standard Hazards**:
   - Spikes (all layers, 1-3 stacks)
   - Toxic Spikes (all layers, 1-2 stacks)
   - Stealth Rock (single layer)
   - Sticky Web (single layer)

2. **Elite Redux Custom Hazards**:
   - Hot Coals (burns entering Pokémon)
   - Caltrops (damages entering Pokémon)

### Important Limitations:
- **No Immunity**: Pickup does NOT prevent hazard damage on entry
- **Takes Damage First**: The Pokémon suffers full hazard effects before clearing them
- **Side-Specific**: Only clears hazards on the user's side of the field
- **No Protection**: Does not prevent future hazard setting

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability Pickup = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        int side = GetBattlerSide(battler);
        CHECK(gSideStatuses[side] & SIDE_STATUS_HAZARDS_ANY || gSideTimers[side].hotCoals || gSideTimers[side].caltrops)

        gSideStatuses[side] &= ~(SIDE_STATUS_STEALTH_ROCK | SIDE_STATUS_TOXIC_SPIKES | SIDE_STATUS_SPIKES | SIDE_STATUS_STICKY_WEB);
        gSideTimers[side].spikesAmount = 0;
        gSideTimers[side].toxicSpikesAmount = 0;
        gSideTimers[side].hotCoals = FALSE;
        gSideTimers[side].caltrops = FALSE;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_PickUpActivate);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Hazard Damage Sequence:
1. Pokémon enters battle
2. Takes damage from all active hazards (Spikes, Stealth Rock, etc.)
3. Pickup ability activates
4. All hazards on user's side are cleared
5. Message displays: "{Pokémon} removed hazards on its field side!"

### Strategic Implications:
- **Hazard Control**: Excellent for teams vulnerable to hazard stacking
- **Entry Support**: Useful for frail sweepers that need clean entry
- **Limited Value**: Less useful against single-use hazards like Stealth Rock
- **Suicidal Risk**: May KO itself to hazards before clearing them

### Competitive Usage:
- **Hazard-Weak Teams**: Essential for teams with multiple hazard-weak Pokémon
- **Pivot Role**: Can be used to clear hazards before bringing in key team members
- **Risk Management**: Must consider if the Pokémon can survive initial hazard damage
- **Limited Scope**: Doesn't help against opponent's hazards or provide ongoing protection

### Synergies:
- **Heavy-Duty Boots**: Prevents hazard damage while still clearing them
- **Focus Sash**: Ensures survival to clear hazards even with chip damage
- **Healing Moves**: Can recover from hazard damage after clearing

### Counters:
- **Immediate Re-hazarding**: Opponents can immediately reset hazards after Pickup activation
- **Multi-hazard Stacking**: Heavy hazard damage may KO before clearing
- **Priority Moves**: Can finish off weakened Pickup users

### Version History:
- Elite Redux: Expanded to include custom hazards (Hot Coals, Caltrops)
- Original: Cleared standard entry hazards only
- Note: This is a complete rework from the original Pickup ability which collected items
