# Ground Shock - Ability ID 285

## In-Game Description
"Target Grounds aren't immune to Electric but resist it instead."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Ground Shock allows Electric moves to hit Ground-type Pokemon for 0.5x damage instead of immunity. Electric attacks like Thunder and Thunderbolt become super effective against Ground types but deal reduced damage. This removes the traditional Electric immunity while providing damage resistance.

*Character count: 295*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Ground Shock fundamentally alters the type effectiveness system for Electric vs Ground matchups. Normally, Electric-type moves have 0x effectiveness against Ground-type Pokemon (complete immunity). This ability modifies that interaction to 0.5x effectiveness (resistance).

**Technical Implementation:**
- Triggers on `onTypeEffectiveness` hook
- Checks if moveType == TYPE_ELECTRIC and defType == TYPE_GROUND
- Sets damage modifier to 0.5x (UQ_4_12(.5) in the code)
- Only activates when no other modifier is already present

**Practical Effects:**
- Electric moves can now damage Ground-type Pokemon
- Damage is reduced to 50% of normal effectiveness
- Applies to all Electric-type attacks (Thunder, Thunderbolt, Discharge, etc.)
- Does not affect other type interactions
- Ground types retain all other resistances and immunities

**Strategic Implications:**
- Makes Ground-type Pokemon vulnerable to Electric attacks for the first time
- Provides counterplay against traditionally safe Ground-type switch-ins
- Electric-type Pokemon gain coverage against Ground types
- Ground types are no longer perfect Electric counters but maintain some defensive utility

**Interaction Notes:**
- Does not stack with other type effectiveness modifiers
- The ability must be present on the attacking Pokemon to take effect
- Works in all battle formats and scenarios
- Compatible with moves that have secondary effects (paralysis chance remains normal)
