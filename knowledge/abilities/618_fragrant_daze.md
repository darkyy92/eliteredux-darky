# Fragrant Daze - Ability ID 618

## In-Game Description
"30% chance to confuse on contact."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When hit by a contact move, has a 30% chance to inflict confusion on the attacker. The ability activates during physical attacks that make direct contact with the user. Only affects opponents that can be confused, making it ineffective against certain types or abilities.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Code Location
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
- **Function**: `FragrantDaze` (lines 6488-6499)
- **Trigger**: `ON_EITHER` - activates when receiving damage

### Mechanics
1. **Trigger Condition**: Activates when the user is hit by a move
2. **Contact Requirement**: Only triggers on moves that make contact (`IsMoveMakingContact`)
3. **Confusion Check**: Verifies the attacker can be confused (`CanBeConfused`)
4. **Hit Effect Check**: Confirms ability should apply (`ShouldApplyOnHitAffect`)
5. **Probability**: 30% chance (`Random() % 100 < 30`)
6. **Effect**: Applies confusion status via `AbilityStatusEffectSafe`

### Strategic Applications
- **Defensive Utility**: Punishes physical attackers with potential confusion
- **Contact Moves Only**: Ineffective against special attacks or non-contact physical moves
- **Status Disruption**: Can disrupt opponent's offensive momentum through confusion
- **Type Synergy**: Works well on Pokemon that can tank physical hits

### Pokemon with Fragrant Daze
- **Furfrou Debutante Form**: Has as one of three regular abilities
- **Flairgrance**: Has as an innate ability (always active)

### Technical Details
- **Ability ID**: 618 in the enum system
- **Proto Definition**: Located in `AbilityList.textproto`
- **Status Effect**: Uses `MOVE_EFFECT_CONFUSION` 
- **Safety Check**: Uses `AbilityStatusEffectSafe` to prevent invalid applications

### Interactions and Limitations
- Does not affect Pokemon immune to confusion
- Only triggers on contact moves (Tackle, Bite, etc.)
- Does not trigger on special attacks or non-contact physical moves
- 30% activation rate provides balanced risk/reward
- Can be blocked by abilities that prevent status conditions
