# Seaborne - Ability ID 502

## In-Game Description
"Drizzle + Swift Swim."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Seaborne combines Drizzle and Swift Swim effects. Upon entry, sets rain weather for 8 turns. During any rain weather, the Pokemon's Speed is boosted by 50%. Works with regular rain, heavy rain, and Primordial Sea. Perfect for Water-type sweepers needing both setup and speed.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Seaborne is a powerful combination ability that merges two distinct weather-related effects:
1. **Drizzle component**: Automatically sets rain weather upon entering battle
2. **Swift Swim component**: Provides 50% Speed boost during any rain weather

The ability essentially makes the Pokemon both a weather setter and a weather abuser simultaneously.

### Activation Conditions
**Drizzle Component:**
- **Entry trigger**: Activates automatically when the Pokemon enters battle
- **Weather setting**: Sets rain weather for 8 turns (Elite Redux extended duration)
- **Priority**: Cannot override Primal weather (Desolate Land/Primordial Sea)
- **Failure cases**: Shows "blocked by primal weather" message if primal weather is active

**Swift Swim Component:**
- **Weather requirement**: Any form of rain weather must be active
  - Regular rain (from Rain Dance, Drizzle, or this ability)
  - Heavy rain (from Downpour - unused but supported)
  - Permanent rain (from abilities like Drizzle)
  - Primordial Sea (primal rain weather)
- **Speed boost**: Multiplies Speed stat by 1.5 (50% increase)
- **Continuous effect**: Active as long as rain weather persists

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Seaborne combines two existing ability implementations
constexpr Ability Seaborne = {
    .onEntry = Drizzle.onEntry,    // Sets rain on entry
    .onStat = SwiftSwim.onStat,    // Speed boost in rain
};

// Drizzle component (entry effect)
.onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
    if (TryChangeBattleWeather(battler, ENUM_WEATHER_RAIN, TRUE)) {
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_DrizzleActivates);
        return TRUE;
    } else if (gBattleWeather & WEATHER_PRIMAL_ANY && WEATHER_HAS_EFFECT) {
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_BlockedByPrimalWeatherEnd3);
        return NO_ANNOUNCE;
    }
    return FALSE;
},

// Swift Swim component (speed boost)
.onStat = +[](ON_STAT) {
    if (statId == STAT_SPEED && IsBattlerWeatherAffected(battler, WEATHER_RAIN_ANY)) 
        *stat *= 1.5;
},
```

### Weather Interactions
**Rain Types Supported:**
- `WEATHER_RAIN_TEMPORARY`: From Rain Dance or similar moves
- `WEATHER_RAIN_DOWNPOUR`: Unused variant but supported
- `WEATHER_RAIN_PERMANENT`: From Drizzle-type abilities
- `WEATHER_RAIN_PRIMAL`: From Primordial Sea

**Weather Override Behavior:**
- Cannot set rain if Desolate Land (extremely harsh sunlight) is active
- Cannot set rain if Primordial Sea is already active (redundant)
- Can be overridden by other weather-setting abilities or moves
- Will show appropriate failure messages when blocked

### Important Interactions
**Entry Scenarios:**
- **Normal entry**: Sets rain and immediately gains Speed boost
- **Primal weather active**: Cannot set rain, but gains Speed boost if Primordial Sea is active
- **Other weather active**: Overrides existing non-primal weather with rain
- **Multiple weather setters**: Last one to enter determines weather

**Speed Boost Mechanics:**
- **Stat calculation**: Applied during Speed stat calculations, not a temporary boost
- **Stackable**: Can stack with other Speed modifiers (Choice Scarf, stat boosts, etc.)
- **Persistent**: Lasts as long as rain weather is active
- **Immediate**: Takes effect instantly when rain becomes active

**Battle AI Recognition:**
```c
case ABILITY_SEABORNE:
case ABILITY_DRIZZLE:
    return AI_SCORE_RAIN;  // AI values this for rain setting
```

### Strategic Implications
**Offensive Advantages:**
- **Self-sufficient setup**: Provides both weather and Speed boost
- **Immediate threat**: Can sweep right after entry
- **Water move synergy**: Rain boosts Water-type moves by 50%
- **Thunder accuracy**: Perfect accuracy Thunder in rain

**Defensive Considerations:**
- **Weather dependency**: Speed boost lost if weather changes
- **Priority moves**: Still vulnerable to priority attacks
- **Weather wars**: Competing weather setters can nullify benefits
- **Ability suppression**: Completely shut down by Mold Breaker variants
