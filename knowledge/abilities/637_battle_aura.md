## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Battle Aura creates an intimidating presence that amplifies critical hit chances for all battlers. This powerful aura increases each Pokemon's critical hit stage by +2, making devastating critical strikes significantly more likely. Enhanced probability transforms battles into encounters.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Battle Aura creates a battlefield-wide effect that dramatically increases the likelihood of critical hits for all Pokemon, fundamentally changing the dynamics of combat.

### Core Mechanics
- **Universal Effect**: Affects all Pokemon on the field (user, allies, and opponents)
- **Critical Hit Boost**: Increases critical hit stage by +2 for all battlers
- **Permanent Aura**: Effect persists as long as the user remains on the field
- **Battlefield Control**: Changes the entire flow of battle through increased critical hit chances

### Critical Hit Probability
- **Base Critical Hit**: ~4.17% chance (1/24)
- **+1 Stage**: ~12.5% chance (1/8)
- **+2 Stage**: ~25% chance (1/4)
- **Battle Aura Effect**: All moves have 25% critical hit chance minimum

### Strategic Applications
- **High-Risk/High-Reward**: Makes battles more volatile and unpredictable
- **Offensive Pressure**: Every attack has significant critical hit potential
- **Defensive Concern**: Opponents also benefit from increased critical hit chances
- **Setup Disruption**: Critical hits can disrupt setup strategies

### Notable Interactions
- **Critical Hit Moves**: Moves with natural high critical hit ratios become extremely dangerous
- **Lucky Chant**: May be countered by abilities that prevent critical hits
- **Shell Armor/Battle Armor**: Pokemon with critical hit immunity unaffected
- **Scope Lens/Razor Claw**: Items that boost critical hits stack with this effect

### Competitive Considerations
- **Double-Edged**: Benefits all Pokemon equally, including opponents
- **RNG Factor**: Increases randomness and unpredictability in battles
- **Wallbreaking**: Critical hits can break through defensive strategies
- **Momentum Swings**: Can create dramatic turn-arounds in battle
