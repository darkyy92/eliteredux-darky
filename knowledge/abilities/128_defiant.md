# Defiant (Ability #128)

## Short Description
Raises Attack by two stages if stats are lowered by an enemy.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*
Defiant triggers when any of the Pok√©mon's stats are lowered by an opponent, immediately boosting Attack by two stages in retaliation. Activates from direct stat drops, moves like Intimidate, and stat-lowering secondary effects. Cannot activate if Attack is already at maximum. Stacks with other boosts.

Character count: 299

## Detailed Mechanics

### Trigger Conditions
- **Stat Drop Source**: Only triggers when stats are lowered by an opponent (not self-inflicted)
- **Any Stat**: Activates when ANY stat is lowered (Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed, Accuracy, or Evasion)
- **Multiple Drops**: Each instance of stat lowering triggers Defiant separately
- **Intimidate**: Specifically triggers against Intimidate and similar abilities

### Boost Details
- **Boost Amount**: +2 stages to Attack stat
- **Maximum Cap**: Cannot activate if Attack is already at +6 stages
- **Stacking**: If multiple stats are lowered simultaneously, Defiant only triggers once per action

### Battle Interactions
- **Priority**: Activates immediately after the stat drop occurs
- **Ability Popup**: Shows ability notification when triggered
- **Turn Order**: Processes in the order stats are lowered

### Strategic Notes
- **Counter to Intimidate**: Excellent counter to Intimidate users, turning their advantage into a disadvantage
- **Sticky Web Counter**: Triggers when switching into Sticky Web
- **Synergy**: Pairs well with moves that lower own stats for additional effects
- **AI Behavior**: AI opponents avoid using stat-lowering moves against Defiant users

### Similar Abilities
- **Competitive**: Special Attack version (boosts Sp. Atk by +2 instead)
- **Contempt**: Combines Defiant with Unaware effects
- **Run Away**: Boosts Speed by +2 when stats are lowered (different stat boost)

### Competitive Usage
Defiant is particularly valuable in formats where Intimidate is common, turning a would-be disadvantage into a powerful Attack boost. Physical attackers with Defiant can use this to set up sweep opportunities when opponents attempt to weaken them.

### Implementation Details
- **Script**: Uses `BattleScript_DefiantActivates` 
- **Check**: Triggered by `STRINGID_DEFENDERSSTATFELL` message
- **Code Location**: Primary logic in `src/battle_util.c`
