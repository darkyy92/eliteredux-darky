# Hyper Cutter - Ability ID 52

## In-Game Description
"Enemies can't lower Atk/SpAtk. Contact moves get +1 Crit."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Hyper Cutter prevents enemies from lowering the user's Attack or Special Attack stats through moves or abilities. All contact moves used by this Pokemon have their critical hit rate increased by one stage. Provides immunity to Intimidate and stat-lowering moves like Growl affecting Attack/SpAtk.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**HYPER CUTTER** is a dual-function ability that provides both stat protection and offensive enhancement in Elite Redux.

### Stat Protection Mechanics:
- **Protection**: Prevents Attack and Special Attack from being lowered by opposing moves or abilities
- **Trigger**: Activates when any opposing source attempts to reduce STAT_ATK or STAT_SPATK
- **Protected Stats**: Attack (-1 to -6 stages) and Special Attack (-1 to -6 stages)
- **Unprotected Stats**: Defense, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, Evasion can still be lowered
- **Message**: Shows ability popup and "It doesn't affect [Pokemon]!" when protection activates

### Critical Hit Enhancement:
- **Trigger**: All contact moves (physical moves that make contact with the target)
- **Effect**: +1 critical hit stage (doubles the base critical hit ratio)
- **Base Crit Rate**: Most moves go from 6.25% (1/16) to 12.5% (1/8) critical hit chance
- **Stacking**: Works with other crit-boosting effects (high crit ratio moves, items, etc.)

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability HyperCutter = {
    .onCrit = +[](ON_CRIT) -> int {
        CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, battler))
        return 1;  // +1 crit stage for contact moves
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,  // Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker
};

// Stat protection handled in battle_script_commands.c:
// Blocks stat reduction when:
// (BATTLER_HAS_ABILITY(battler, ABILITY_HYPER_CUTTER) && 
//  (statId == STAT_ATK || statId == STAT_SPATK))
```

### Contact Move Examples:
**Common Contact Moves that get +1 Crit:**
- Tackle, Quick Attack, Body Slam, Double-Edge
- Punch moves: Mach Punch, Ice Punch, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch
- Slash, Night Slash, Psycho Cut, Leaf Blade (already high crit + Hyper Cutter = very high crit)
- U-turn, Flip Turn (pivoting moves)
- Most physical moves except: Earthquake, Rock Slide, Stone Edge, Flamethrower-type moves

**Non-Contact Moves (no crit bonus):**
- Earthquake, Rock Slide, Surf, Flamethrower
- Projectile moves: Shadow Ball, Aura Sphere, Focus Blast
- Most special attacks

### Stat Protection Interactions:
**Blocked Moves/Effects:**
- Intimidate: Complete immunity, no Attack reduction
- Growl, Leer (Attack reduction portion), Tickle (Attack portion)
- Charm, Sweet Kiss effects on Attack/Special Attack
- Stat-lowering secondary effects on protected stats

**NOT Blocked:**
- Self-inflicted stat drops (Overheat reducing own Special Attack)
- Stat drops from abilities that affect the user
- Other stat reductions (Defense, Speed, etc.)
- Stat reductions from status conditions

### Competitive Applications:

**Offensive Synergy:**
- High-crit contact moves become extremely reliable (Leaf Blade, Night Slash, etc.)
- Pairs well with Scope Lens or Razor Claw for even higher crit rates
- Physical attackers benefit from both crit boost and Attack protection
- Excellent for revenge killers and physical sweepers

**Defensive Utility:**
- Complete immunity to Intimidate cycling strategies
- Protects setup sweepers from having Attack/Special Attack weakened
- Maintains offensive pressure even against stat-lowering teams
- Valuable against utility moves like Growl, Charm, and Tickle

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **Limited Protection**: Only covers Attack and Special Attack, not all stats
- **Mold Breaker Vulnerability**: Can be bypassed by Mold Breaker abilities
- **Contact Requirement**: Crit bonus only applies to contact moves
- **Physical Focus**: Benefits physical attackers more than special attackers

### Notable Users:
- **Galarian Farfetch'd**: Combines with Fighting-type STAB contact moves
- **Crabominable**: Benefits both abilities with powerful contact Ice/Fighting moves
- **Various Rock/Water types**: Access to contact moves like Aqua Jet, Ice Punch

### Interaction Priority:
- Stat protection activates during damage calculation/stat modification phase
- Critical hit bonus calculated during hit chance determination
- Works alongside other crit-enhancing abilities (does not stack with Super Luck)
- Protection cannot be bypassed except by Mold Breaker variants

### Version Notes:
- Elite Redux: Enhanced from original with critical hit bonus addition
- Original games: Only provided Attack stat protection (not Special Attack)
- Elite Redux expansion: Both Attack AND Special Attack protection + crit bonus
- Message: Uses standard "It doesn't affect [Pokemon]!" for stat protection
