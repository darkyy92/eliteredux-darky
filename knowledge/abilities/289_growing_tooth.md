# Growing Tooth - Ability ID 289

## In-Game Description
"Raises Attack by one stage after using a biting move."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Growing Tooth boosts the user's Attack by one stage whenever they successfully use a biting move. This includes all fang attacks like Thunder Fang and Ice Fang, plus bite attacks like Crunch and Hyper Fang. The boost activates after damage calculation, building momentum for future attacks.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Growing Tooth activates whenever the user successfully uses a move with the `FLAG_STRONG_JAW_BOOST` flag. Upon successful use, it raises the user's Attack stat by one stage (+50% Attack).

### Activation Conditions
- Must successfully use a biting move (move must have `FLAG_STRONG_JAW_BOOST`)
- Triggers only when `ShouldApplyOnHitAffect` returns true
- Activates after damage calculation but before the move fully resolves
- The stat boost must be possible (not already at +6 Attack)

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability GrowingTooth = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].flags & FLAG_STRONG_JAW_BOOST)
        CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, STAT_ATK, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER, NULL))

        gBattleScripting.battler = battler;
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_AttackBoostActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Strong Jaw**: Stacks multiplicatively - Strong Jaw boosts damage, Growing Tooth boosts future Attack
- **Sheer Force**: If user has Sheer Force, moves lose secondary effects but Growing Tooth still activates
- **Moxie**: Both abilities can trigger from the same KO, providing +2 Attack total
- **Choice Items**: Growing Tooth can still activate while locked into a Choice item
- **Substitute**: Activates even when attacking through Substitute

### Strategic Implications
- **Snowball Potential**: Each successful biting move makes subsequent attacks stronger
- **Early Game Setup**: Weak biting moves like Bite become setup tools
- **Late Game Power**: Strong moves like Crunch become even more devastating after boosts
- **Multi-hit Consideration**: Each hit of multi-hit biting moves can potentially trigger (though most biting moves are single-hit)

### Example Damage Calculations
Assuming 100 base Attack, neutral nature, level 50:
- **Base Attack**: 120 (no boosts)
- **After 1 Growing Tooth**: 180 (+50%)
- **After 2 Growing Tooth**: 240 (+100%)
- **After 3 Growing Tooth**: 300 (+150%)

### Common Users
**Natural Learners** (Pokemon that learn multiple biting moves):
- Mightyena line (Bite, Crunch, Thunder/Ice/Fire Fang)
- Crobat line (Bite, Crunch, Leech Life)
- Sharpedo line (Bite, Crunch, Aqua Fang)
- Tyranitar line (Bite, Crunch)

**Synergistic Pokemon**:
- Physical attackers with diverse movepools
- Pokemon with access to setup moves + biting moves
- Fast sweepers that can capitalize on Attack boosts

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Tier Placement**: Strong on physical attackers with good Speed
- **Team Role**: Physical sweeper/wallbreaker
- **Preferred Formats**: Singles > Doubles (easier to get multiple boosts)
- **Item Synergy**: Life Orb, Choice Band, Muscle Band

### Counters
- **Intimidate**: Reduces Attack boosts' effectiveness
- **Burn**: Halves physical damage output
- **Physical Walls**: Resist boosted attacks
- **Priority Moves**: Revenge kill before setup complete
- **Taunt**: Prevents setup if relying on non-attacking moves first

### Synergies  
- **Strong Jaw**: Perfect partner ability for maximum biting move effectiveness
- **Technician**: Boosts weak biting moves used for setup
- **Speed Boost**: Ensures ability to capitalize on Attack boosts
- **Adaptability**: Enhances STAB biting moves further

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Custom ability implementation
- **Mechanic**: Based on Strong Jaw's move flagging system
- **Balance**: Moderate power level - requires successful hits to build up
