# Patchwork - Ability ID 693

## In-Game Description
Like Disguise, but curses attacker when disguise breaks (25% HP/turn).

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Blocks the first damaging move that hits the Pokemon and changes its form after. Only non-status moves are blocked. In fog, the disguise is restored immediately once per switch in, or when fog is set again. When the disguise breaks, the attacker becomes cursed.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Patchwork functions identically to Disguise, but with a vengeful twist. When the Pokemon's disguise is broken by taking damage, it automatically curses the attacker. The curse inflicts ongoing damage equal to 25% of the opponent's maximum HP each turn until they switch out or faint.
