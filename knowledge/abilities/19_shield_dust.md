# Shield Dust - Ability ID 19

## In-Game Description
"Immune to added move effects, hazards, and powder moves."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Shield Dust provides triple protection: blocks all secondary effects from damaging moves (burn, paralysis, stat drops), grants complete immunity to entry hazards (Stealth Rock, Spikes), and nullifies all powder-based moves. Elite Redux significantly expanded this ability's defensive coverage.

*Character count: 286*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Shield Dust has been massively buffed in Elite Redux, providing three distinct types of protection:

```c
constexpr Ability ShieldDust = {
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .powderImmune = TRUE,
};
```

### 1. Secondary Effect Immunity

Implemented in `battle_script_commands.c` (line 2241), Shield Dust prevents ALL secondary effects from damaging moves:

**Blocked Effects Include**:
- Status conditions: Burn, paralysis, poison, freeze, sleep
- Stat drops: Attack, Defense, Speed, etc. reductions
- Flinching: From moves like Iron Head, Rock Slide
- Confusion: From moves like Water Pulse, Dynamic Punch

**Key Details**:
- Only blocks SECONDARY effects (30% burn chance on Scald)
- Does NOT block PRIMARY effects (Will-O-Wisp still burns)
- Uses `IsPreventableSecondaryEffect()` function
- Works alongside Covert Cloak item

### 2. Entry Hazard Immunity

Implemented in `battle_util.c` (`IsBattlerAffectedByHazards()` at line 8306):

**Complete Immunity To**:
- Stealth Rock
- Spikes (all layers)
- Toxic Spikes
- Sticky Web

**Mechanics**:
- Functions like built-in Heavy-Duty Boots
- Prevents all hazard damage on switch-in
- Does NOT clear hazards, just ignores them

### 3. Powder Move Immunity

Via the `powderImmune = TRUE` flag:

**Blocks All Powder Moves**:
- Sleep Powder
- Stun Spore  
- Poison Powder
- Spore
- Rage Powder
- Cotton Spore
- Magic Powder
- Any move with powder properties

**Implementation**:
- Checked by `IsPowderImmune()` in `battle_util.c` (line 3006)
- Powder moves fail completely against Shield Dust users

### Ability Properties
- **breakable = TRUE**: Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker
- All three immunities are suppressed when ability is broken

### Strategic Implications

**Defensive Profile**:
- Safe switches into hazard-heavy fields
- Immune to status powder strategies
- Protection from RNG secondary effects
- Reliable defensive consistency

**Team Value**:
- Less reliance on Defog/Rapid Spin
- Counters hazard stacking strategies
- Shuts down powder sleep leads
- Reduces battle RNG

### Key Code Locations
- **Ability Definition**: `src/abilities.cc` (line 522)
- **Secondary Effects**: `src/battle_script_commands.c` (line 2241)
- **Hazard Immunity**: `src/battle_util.c` (line 8306)
- **Powder Immunity**: `src/battle_util.c` (line 3006)

### Pokémon with Shield Dust
Typically found on Bug-type Pokémon and those with protective scales or dusty coatings. The expanded immunities make it valuable on many defensive and support Pokémon.

### Competitive Usage Notes

**Advantages**:
- Eliminates three major battle hazards in one ability slot
- Perfect for leads and pivots
- Counters RNG-heavy strategies
- Enables safer setup

**Limitations**:
- No offensive benefits
- Vulnerable to Mold Breaker
- Primary effects still work
- Doesn't prevent direct damage

### Counters
- Mold Breaker bypasses all immunities
- Direct status moves (Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp)
- Primary effect moves work normally
- Raw offensive pressure

### Synergies
- Pivot Pokémon benefit from hazard immunity
- Setup sweepers appreciate RNG protection
- Defensive cores value consistent switches
- Teams weak to hazards gain flexibility

### Comparison to Similar Effects
- **Heavy-Duty Boots**: Only blocks hazards
- **Covert Cloak**: Only blocks secondary effects
- **Safety Goggles**: Only blocks powder/weather
- **Shield Dust**: Combines all three protections

### Version History
Elite Redux transformed Shield Dust:
- **Original**: Only blocked secondary effects
- **Elite Redux**: Added hazard immunity + powder immunity

This makes Shield Dust one of the most comprehensive defensive abilities in the game, providing unparalleled protection against common battle mechanics.
