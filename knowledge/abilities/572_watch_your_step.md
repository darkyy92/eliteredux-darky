# Watch Your Step - Ability ID 572

## In-Game Description
"Spreads two layers of Spikes on switch-in."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Upon switching in, the Pokemon scatters sharp spikes across the opponent's battlefield, creating two layers of Spikes that damage grounded enemies who switch in. Each layer increases the damage dealt by enemy hazards.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Watch Your Step** is a switch-in ability that automatically spreads two layers of Spikes on the opponent's side of the field when the Pokemon enters battle.

### Core Mechanics
- **Activation**: Triggers automatically when the Pokemon switches into battle
- **Effect**: Adds 2 layers of Spikes to the opponent's side of the field
- **Maximum Layers**: Cannot exceed 3 total layers of Spikes
- **Stacking**: If opponent already has 1 layer, adds 1 more (capping at 3)
- **Blockable**: Does not activate if opponent already has 3 layers of Spikes

### Spikes Damage Formula
```c
u8 spikesDmg = (5 - spikesAmount) * 2;
damage = maxHP / spikesDmg;
```

**Damage per layer:**
- 1 layer: 1/8 HP damage (12.5%)
- 2 layers: 1/6 HP damage (~16.7%)
- 3 layers: 1/4 HP damage (25%)

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability WatchYourStep = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        u8 targetSide = GetOppositeSide(battler);
        CHECK(gSideTimers[targetSide].spikesAmount < 3)
        
        gSideTimers[targetSide].spikesAmount = min(gSideTimers[targetSide].spikesAmount + 2, 3);
        gSideStatuses[targetSide] |= SIDE_STATUS_SPIKES;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_DoubleSpikesOnEntry);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Affected Conditions
- **Grounded Pokemon**: Only affects Pokemon that make contact with the ground
- **Immune**: Flying-types, Levitate users, Air Balloon holders, Magnet Rise users
- **Magic Guard**: Pokemon with Magic Guard are immune to Spikes damage
- **Removal**: Cleared by Defog, Rapid Spin, Court Change, or switching abilities like Pickup

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Multiple Layers**: Combines with existing Spikes layers up to maximum of 3
- **Entry Hazards**: Works alongside Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web
- **Defog/Rapid Spin**: Can be cleared by these moves
- **Court Change**: Spikes can be swapped to the user's side
- **Magic Bounce**: Does not interact with Magic Bounce (not a targeted move)

### Strategic Implications
- **Immediate Pressure**: Forces opponent to take damage on every switch-in
- **Pivot Punishment**: Heavily punishes switching strategies
- **Hazard Stacking**: Excellent for hazard-heavy teams
- **Entry Control**: Discourages frequent switching by opponent

### Example Damage Calculations
For a 300 HP Pokemon:
- **After Watch Your Step**: 2 layers = 300 รท 6 = 50 HP damage per switch-in
- **With 1 existing layer**: 3 layers = 300 รท 4 = 75 HP damage per switch-in
- **No existing layers**: 2 layers = 300 รท 6 = 50 HP damage per switch-in

### Common Users
- **Mega Garbodor**: Has Watch Your Step as an innate ability
- **Iron Treads**: Can have Watch Your Step as a regular ability option
- **Defensive Pokemon**: Typically found on bulky Pokemon that can afford to set hazards

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Lead Potential**: Excellent for lead Pokemon to establish immediate field control
- **Defensive Cores**: Fits well in defensive teams that focus on hazard stacking
- **Switchin Punishment**: Heavily punishes opponents who rely on frequent switching
- **Hazard Support**: Reduces need for manual Spikes setting

### Counters
- **Hazard Removal**: Defog, Rapid Spin, Tidy Up users
- **Flying Types**: Immune to Spikes damage
- **Levitate**: Immunity to ground-based hazards
- **Magic Guard**: Prevents indirect damage
- **Heavy-Duty Boots**: Item that prevents hazard damage

### Synergies
- **Stealth Rock**: Combines for massive switch-in pressure
- **Toxic Spikes**: Creates a hazard-heavy field
- **Trapping Abilities**: Shadow Tag, Arena Trap force opponents to take damage
- **Pursuit**: Punishes switching attempts further
- **Sticky Web**: Adds Speed reduction to the hazard stack
