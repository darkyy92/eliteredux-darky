Bloodlust combines the terrifying effects of Blood Bath and Soul Eater abilities. When this Pokémon inflicts bleeding on an opponent, it simultaneously strikes fear into their heart, causing both physical and psychological trauma. The Pokémon itself is immune to bleeding effects, making it a ruthless predator that feeds on combat. Upon knocking out any opposing Pokémon, Bloodlust restores 25% of the user's maximum HP, turning every victory into a feeding frenzy that sustains prolonged battles.
