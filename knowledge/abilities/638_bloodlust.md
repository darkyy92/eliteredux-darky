# Bloodlust - Ability ID 638

## In-Game Description
"Combines Blood Bath and Soul Eater effects."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Immunity to the bleeding. When this Pokemon successfully inflicts bleeding on an opponent, it also gains Fear. Fear traps the target for 2 turns and they take 50% more damage. If forced out by moves like Whirlwind, the target loses Fear. Also recovers 25% of max HP when scoring a direct KO.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Bloodlust is an ultimate predator ability that combines bleeding immunity, fear induction, and life drain mechanics, creating a terrifying battlefield presence.

### Core Mechanics
- **Blood Bath Effect**: Immune to bleeding; inflicting bleeding causes Fear in non-feared targets
- **Soul Eater Effect**: Restores 25% max HP when knocking out opposing Pokemon
- **Bleeding Immunity**: Complete immunity to bleeding status condition
- **Dual Benefit**: Both Blood Bath and Soul Eater effects apply simultaneously

### Fear and Healing Synergy
- **Fear Induction**: Bleeding attacks create Fear status in targets
- **Life Drain**: KO victories restore significant HP
- **Sustained Combat**: Healing enables prolonged battles
- **Psychological Warfare**: Fear prevents opponent switching

### Strategic Applications
- **Predator Build**: Perfect for aggressive, sustained offensive strategies
- **Status Immunity**: Cannot be affected by bleeding-based counters
- **Self-Sustaining**: Healing from KOs maintains battle presence
- **Control Elements**: Fear prevents defensive switching tactics

### Notable Interactions
- **Bleeding Moves**: Any bleeding-inflicting move or ability triggers fear
- **KO Requirements**: Must deliver the final blow to trigger healing
- **Fear Duration**: Fear persists until switch-out or cure
- **HP Management**: 25% healing can be significant on high-HP Pokemon

### Synergy Potential
- **Offensive Items**: Life Orb damage offset by healing from KOs
- **Contact Abilities**: Pairs with contact-based bleeding abilities
- **Aggressive Teams**: Enhances sweep potential through sustain
- **Status Strategies**: Provides multiple status effect options
