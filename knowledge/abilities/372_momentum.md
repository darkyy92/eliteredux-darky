# Momentum - Ability ID 372

## In-Game Description
"Contact moves use the Speed stat for damage calculation."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Contact moves use Speed stat for damage instead of Attack/Special Attack. Perfect for fast physical attackers with mediocre offensive stats. Speed boosts directly become damage boosts. Works with all contact moves. Popular on Crobat, Electrode, Zebstrika. Synergizes well with Choice Scarf.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**MOMENTUM** fundamentally alters damage calculation by replacing offensive stats with Speed for all contact moves.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: Any contact move (physical or special)
- **Effect**: Replaces Attack/SpA with Speed in damage formula
- **Stage Application**: Speed stages apply instead of Atk/SpA stages
- **Complete Replacement**: Not additive, full substitution

### Technical Implementation:
**Location**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 3853-3858)
```cpp
constexpr Ability Momentum = {
    .onChooseOffensiveStat =
        +[](ON_CHOOSE_OFFENSIVE_STAT) {
            if (gBattleMoves[move].contact) *atkStatToUse = STAT_SPEED;
        },
};
```

### Affected Moves:
**Physical Contact** (most common):
- Volt Tackle, Flare Blitz, Double-Edge
- Close Combat, High Jump Kick, Cross Chop
- U-turn, Brave Bird, Acrobatics
- Quick Attack, Extreme Speed, Mach Punch
- All punching moves, Tackle variants

**Special Contact** (rare):
- Grass Knot
- Draining Kiss
- Petal Dance
- Trump Card

### Pokemon with Momentum:

**As Changeable Ability**:
- Crobat (Poison/Flying)
- Furret (Normal)
- Linoone (Normal)
- Zigzagoon (Normal)
- Skarmory Redux (Steel/Flying)
- Skarmory Mega Redux
- Voltorb/Electrode (Electric)
- Electrode Hisuian (Electric/Grass)
- Zebstrika (Electric)
- Accelgor (Bug)
- Tsareena Redux (Grass)
- Inteleon (Water)
- Velozel (Custom)

**As Innate Ability**:
- Iron Leaves (Grass/Psychic)

### Strategic Applications:

1. **Stat Efficiency**:
   - 252 Speed EVs provide both offense and turn order
   - No need to split between Speed and Attack
   - Can invest remaining EVs in bulk

2. **Setup Synergy**:
   - Agility = +2 to damage
   - Rock Polish = +2 to damage
   - Tailwind = double damage for team
   - Speed Boost = cumulative damage increase

3. **Item Optimization**:
   - Choice Scarf: 1.5x Speed = 1.5x damage
   - Life Orb: Standard 1.3x boost
   - Choice Band: Still 1.5x on physical contact

### Damage Example:
**Electrode with Momentum**:
- Attack: 150 (base 50)
- Speed: 450 (base 150)
- Using Volt Tackle: 3x more damage with Speed

### Counters:
1. **Speed Control**:
   - Paralysis (-50% Speed = -50% damage)
   - Sticky Web entry hazard
   - Icy Wind, Electroweb
   - Trick Room reversal

2. **Contact Punishment**:
   - Rough Skin, Iron Barbs
   - Rocky Helmet
   - Flame Body, Static
   - Spiky Shield variants

3. **Priority Moves**: Bypass speed advantage

### Notable Synergies:

**Weather/Abilities**:
- Swift Swim (2x Speed in rain)
- Chlorophyll (2x Speed in sun)
- Sand Rush (2x Speed in sand)
- Slush Rush (2x Speed in hail)

**Support**:
- Baton Pass (receive Speed boosts)
- Flame Charge (self-boost)
- Tailwind (team support)

### Common Sets:

**Zebstrika @ Choice Scarf**
- Volt Tackle
- Flare Blitz
- High Jump Kick
- U-turn

**Crobat @ Life Orb**
- Brave Bird
- Cross Poison
- U-turn
- Roost

### Important Interactions:
- Burn does NOT reduce damage (affects Attack only)
- Intimidate does NOT reduce damage
- Power Split averages Speed if using contact
- Foul Play ignores Momentum

### Competitive Value:
Momentum creates a unique niche for speed-focused Pokemon, turning defensive speedsters into offensive threats. The ability rewards aggressive speed control and synergizes with the fast-paced Elite Redux meta. Investment simplicity and setup potential make it extremely valuable on the right Pokemon.

### Version Notes:
- Elite Redux exclusive ability
- Works with both physical and special contact
- Integrates with 4-ability system
