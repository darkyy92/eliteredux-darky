# Nika - Ability ID 469

## In-Game Description
"Iron fist + Water moves function normally under sun."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Nika combines Iron Fist's 30% power boost to punching moves with protection for Water-type attacks in sunny weather. While Water moves normally deal reduced damage in sun, Nika prevents this penalty, allowing them to function at full power. Perfect for mixed attackers.

*Character count: 295*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Nika is a hybrid offensive ability that provides two distinct benefits:
1. **Iron Fist component**: 30% damage boost to all punching moves
2. **Water move protection**: Prevents the 50% damage reduction Water-type moves normally suffer in sunny weather

### Iron Fist Component
**Move qualification**: Uses the same logic as Iron Fist ability
- Moves with `FLAG_IRON_FIST_BOOST` flag get 1.3x damage multiplier
- Includes moves like Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Drain Punch, etc.
- Extended to Dragon-type moves with Brawling Wyvern ability
- Extended to Striker moves with Junshi Sanda ability

**Damage calculation**:
```c
if (IsIronFistBoosted(battler, move)) MUL(1.3);
```

### Water Move Protection Component
**Weather interaction**: In sunny weather conditions, Water-type moves normally receive a damage penalty:
- Regular sun: 50% damage reduction (0.5x multiplier)
- Harsh sunlight (Desolate Land): Water moves completely fail

**Nika's protection**: The ability specifically prevents the damage reduction:
```c
if (moveType == TYPE_WATER) {
    u16 modifier = CHECK_WEATHER_DOUBLE_BOOST(1.5, 0.5); // 0.5x in sun
    if (modifier < UQ_4_12(1.0)) {
        if (BATTLER_HAS_ABILITY(battlerAtk, ABILITY_NIKA))
            modifier = UQ_4_12(1.0); // Reset to normal damage
    }
}
```

### Important Limitations
- **Desolate Land immunity**: Nika does NOT allow Water moves to work in extremely harsh sunlight (Desolate Land)
- **Only damage reduction**: Prevents the 0.5x multiplier but doesn't boost Water moves beyond normal power
- **No fire boost negation**: Fire moves still get their 1.5x boost in sun against Nika users

### Technical Implementation
The ability is implemented with dual functionality:
```c
constexpr Ability Nika = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = IronFist.onOffensiveMultiplier, // 1.3x punching moves
};
```

Plus special case handling in weather damage calculation for Water-type moves.

### Strategic Applications

**Mixed Attacker Role**:
- Use punching moves for Iron Fist boost
- Use Water moves without sun penalty
- Excellent for Pokemon with diverse movepools

**Sun Team Integration**:
- Functions well on sun teams despite using Water moves
- Can use moves like Surf/Hydro Pump without weather penalty
- Fire/Fighting/Water coverage becomes viable

**Move Synergies**:
- **Punching moves**: Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch (boosted)
- **Water moves**: Surf, Hydro Pump, Scald (protected from sun penalty) 
- **Mixed sets**: Can run both punching and Water moves effectively

### Competitive Viability

**Strengths**:
- Unique niche for mixed sun team members
- Punching moves get consistent 30% boost
- Water moves remain viable in sun matchups
- Good for Pokemon with naturally diverse movepools

**Weaknesses**:
- Still vulnerable to Desolate Land
- Fire moves still get sun boost against user
- Two separate mechanics make it less focused than specialized abilities
- Requires specific movepool to fully utilize

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Items

**Items**:
- **Punching Glove**: Additional 10% boost to punching moves, stacks with Nika
- **Heat Rock**: Extends sun duration, maintaining Fire-type advantages

**Weather abilities**:
- **Drought**: Creates sun that Nika partially counters
- **Desolate Land**: Still completely prevents Water moves despite Nika
- **Drizzle**: Makes the Water protection component irrelevant

### Pokemon Applications
Ideal for Pokemon that:
- Learn both punching moves AND Water-type moves
- Have mixed offensive stats
- Want to function on sun teams despite Water typing
- Need coverage moves that work in multiple weather conditions

### Counters and Counterplay
- **Desolate Land**: Completely shuts down Water moves
- **Rain teams**: Makes Water protection pointless while boosting opponent's Water moves
- **Pure special attackers**: Can't utilize the punching move component
- **Cloud Nine/Air Lock**: Negates weather effects entirely

### Unique Characteristics
Nika is one of the few abilities that provides protection against weather-based damage modifications rather than just immunity or additional effects. This makes it particularly valuable for Pokemon that want to maintain move diversity across different weather conditions.
