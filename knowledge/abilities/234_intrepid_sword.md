# Intrepid Sword - Ability ID 234

## In-Game Description
"On entry, raises Attack by one stage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Intrepid Sword raises the Pokemon's Attack stat by one stage when switching into battle. This boost triggers immediately upon entry and cannot be blocked by Clear Body or similar abilities. Perfect for physical attackers needing immediate power.

*Character count: 287*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Trigger**: When the Pokemon with Intrepid Sword switches into battle (entry ability)

**Effect**: Raises the user's Attack stat by one stage (+50% Attack)

**Technical Details**:
- Uses the same code structure as Dauntless Shield but for Attack instead of Defense
- Checks if the stat can be raised using `CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_ATK)` before activating
- Uses `SetStatChanger(STAT_ATK, 1)` to apply exactly one stage boost
- Calls `BattleScript_BattlerAbilityStatRaiseOnSwitchIn` for the battle message
- Cannot be prevented by abilities like Clear Body, White Smoke, or Hyper Cutter that prevent stat reduction
- Will fail if the Pokemon's Attack is already at maximum (+6 stages)
- Activates every time the Pokemon switches in, not just the first time

**Pokemon with this Ability**:
- Mega Gallade (all three ability slots, plus innate abilities: Dual Wield, Fatal Precision, Avenger)
- Used as innate ability on certain other Pokemon

**Related Abilities**:
- Dauntless Shield (ID 235): Same effect but raises Defense instead of Attack
- Embody Aspect variants: Similar entry stat boosts for different stats
- Crowned Sword (ID 527): Combines Intrepid Sword with Anger Point effects

**Notes**:
- This is a signature ability from Pokemon Sword/Shield, faithfully implemented in Elite Redux
- The ability is particularly powerful in Elite Redux's 4-ability system when used as an innate ability
- Triggers before any other entry effects or abilities that might depend on stats
