# Smokey Maneuvers

**Effect:** Evasion is boosted by 1.25x in fog.

## Extended In-Game Description
This ability grants enhanced evasiveness in foggy conditions. When fog weather is active (permanent or temporary), opponents' accuracy against this Pokemon is reduced by 25%, making it harder to hit. This defensive boost makes the Pokemon particularly effective in fog-based weather teams.
