# Terminal Velocity - Ability ID 552

## In-Game Description
"Special moves use 20% of its Speed stat additionally."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Terminal Velocity adds 20% of the Pokemon's Speed stat to its Special Attack when using special moves. This bonus is calculated after stat stages and applies to the entire damage formula. Works with all special attacks including signature moves and Hidden Power. Particularly devastating on fast special sweepers.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Terminal Velocity is a powerful offensive ability that enhances special attacks by incorporating the user's Speed stat into damage calculations.

### Core Mechanics
- **Activation**: Triggers automatically when using any special move (split == SPLIT_SPECIAL)
- **Effect**: Adds 20% of the user's current Speed stat to the Special Attack stat for damage calculation
- **Implementation**: Uses the `onChooseOffensiveStat` hook with `secondaryAtkStatToUse[STAT_SPEED] += 20`

### Technical Implementation
The ability works through Elite Redux's secondary stat system:

```c
constexpr Ability TerminalVelocity = {
    .onChooseOffensiveStat =
        +[](ON_CHOOSE_OFFENSIVE_STAT) {
            if (IS_MOVE_SPECIAL(move)) secondaryAtkStatToUse[STAT_SPEED] += 20;
        },
};
```

In the damage calculation (`CalculateStat` function):
```c
// Line 7083: Add 20% of current Speed stat to Special Attack
statBase += CalculateStat(battler, STAT_SPEED, 0, move, isAttack, isCrit, isUnaware, TRUE) * 20 / 100;
```

### Calculation Order
1. Base Special Attack stat is calculated with stages/modifiers
2. Current Speed stat is calculated with stages/modifiers  
3. 20% of Speed (Speed x 0.2) is added to Special Attack
4. Final Special Attack value is used in damage formula

### Affected Moves
- **All Special Moves**: Any move with split == SPLIT_SPECIAL
- **Status Moves**: Not affected (only damaging special moves)
- **Physical Moves**: Not affected
- **Multi-hit Moves**: Each hit benefits from the Speed bonus
- **Signature Moves**: Includes custom Elite Redux special moves

### Interactions with Other Mechanics
- **Stat Stages**: Speed boosts directly increase the damage bonus
- **Wonder Room**: If Wonder Room swaps Attack/Sp.Attack, Terminal Velocity still adds Speed to the effective attacking stat
- **Critical Hits**: Speed bonus applies regardless of critical hit status
- **Weather**: Speed modifiers from weather (Swift Swim, Chlorophyll) enhance the damage bonus
- **Items**: Choice Scarf and other Speed-boosting items increase the damage bonus
- **Abilities**: Speed-boosting abilities like Speed Boost multiply the Terminal Velocity effect

### Strategic Implications
- **Ideal Users**: Fast special attackers (130+ Speed, 100+ Sp.Attack)
- **Speed Investment**: EVs in Speed provide both priority and damage
- **Speed Control**: Tailwind, Agility, and other speed boosts increase damage output
- **Late Game Power**: Becomes stronger as Speed is boosted throughout battle

### Example Damage Calculations
**Base Scenario**: Pokemon with 300 Sp.Attack, 400 Speed
- Normal Special Attack: 300
- With Terminal Velocity: 300 + (400 x 0.2) = 380 Special Attack
- **Damage Increase**: ~26.7%

**After Speed Boost**: Same Pokemon with +1 Speed (600 Speed)
- With Terminal Velocity: 300 + (600 x 0.2) = 420 Special Attack  
- **Damage Increase**: ~40%

**Choice Scarf Scenario**: 400 Speed to 600 Speed (1.5x modifier)
- With Terminal Velocity: 300 + (600 x 0.2) = 420 Special Attack
- **Total multiplier from Scarf + Terminal Velocity**: Significant damage increase

### Common Users
Based on SpeciesList.textproto analysis:
- **Kilowattrel line**: Electric/Flying types with high Speed (125 base)
- **Iron Valiant**: Psychic/Fairy legendary with 135 Speed
- Various fast special attackers across different tiers
- Often paired with other Speed-boosting abilities as innates

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Team Role**: Primary special sweeper or speed control abuser  
- **Setup Requirements**: Benefits from speed control moves (Tailwind, Agility)
- **Priority Targets**: Pokemon that can boost Speed reliably
- **Synergy Abilities**: Speed Boost, Swift Swim, Chlorophyll as innate abilities

### Counters
- **Speed Control**: Trick Room negates Speed advantage
- **Priority Moves**: Bypass Speed advantage entirely  
- **Special Walls**: High Sp.Defense still tanks boosted attacks
- **Status Effects**: Paralysis cuts Speed and damage bonus in half
- **Intimidate**: While it doesn't affect Sp.Attack directly, it can force switches

### Synergies
- **Speed Boost**: Continuously increases damage output each turn
- **Swift Swim/Chlorophyll**: Weather-based Speed doubling
- **Choice Scarf**: 1.5x Speed multiplier enhances damage bonus
- **Agility/Rock Polish**: Manual Speed boosting for immediate power spike
- **Tailwind**: Team-wide Speed doubling benefits entire team
