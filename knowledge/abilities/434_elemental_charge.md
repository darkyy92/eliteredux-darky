# Elemental Charge - Ability ID 434

## In-Game Description
"20% chance to BRN/FRZ/PARA with respective types."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Elemental Charge gives attacking moves a 20% chance to inflict status conditions based on move type: Electric moves cause paralysis, Fire moves cause burn, and Ice moves cause frostbite. Only affects moves that deal damage to the target. Works with any damaging move of the three types.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Elemental Charge is an offensive ability that provides a 20% chance to inflict type-based status conditions when using damaging moves of Electric, Fire, or Ice type. The ability only triggers on moves that successfully hit and deal damage to the target.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move requirement**: Must be a damaging move that hits the target
- **Type requirement**: Move must be Electric, Fire, or Ice type
- **Chance**: Exactly 20% activation rate (Random() % 100 < 20)
- **Target requirement**: Target must be susceptible to the respective status condition

### Status Effects by Type
- **Electric moves**: Inflict paralysis (if target can be paralyzed)
- **Fire moves**: Inflict burn (if target can be burned)
- **Ice moves**: Inflict frostbite (if target can get frostbite)

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability ElementalCharge = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(target))
        CHECK(Random() % 100 < 20)

        switch (moveType) {
            case TYPE_ELECTRIC:
                CHECK(CanBeParalyzed(battler, target))
                AbilityStatusEffect(MOVE_EFFECT_PARALYSIS);
                return TRUE;

            case TYPE_FIRE:
                CHECK(CanBeBurned(target))
                AbilityStatusEffect(MOVE_EFFECT_BURN);
                return TRUE;

            case TYPE_ICE:
                CHECK(CanGetFrostbite(target))
                AbilityStatusEffect(MOVE_EFFECT_FROSTBITE);
                return TRUE;
        }
        return FALSE;
    },
};
```

### Important Interactions
- **Multi-hit moves**: Each hit has an independent 20% chance to trigger
- **Substitute**: Blocked by Substitute, as it prevents direct hits
- **Type immunity**: Electric moves don't affect Ground types, etc.
- **Status immunity**: Doesn't work on targets immune to the respective status
- **Same-type moves only**: Only Electric, Fire, and Ice moves can trigger effects
- **Frostbite vs Freeze**: Ice moves inflict frostbite, not traditional freeze

### Status Condition Details
- **Paralysis**: 25% chance to be unable to move, Speed reduced by 50%
- **Burn**: Takes 1/16 max HP damage per turn, Attack reduced by 50%
- **Frostbite**: Elite Redux's version of freeze with gradual damage

### Strategic Implications
- **Mixed attackers**: Benefits Pokemon with diverse move pools across the three types
- **Status spreading**: Can cripple multiple opponents in doubles/triples
- **Revenge killer disruption**: Status effects can slow down or weaken threats
- **Type coverage synergy**: Natural fit for Pokemon with Electric/Fire/Ice coverage
- **Reliability**: 20% is significant but not overwhelming for balance

### Move Type Synergies
- **Electric moves**: Thunderbolt, Thunder, Volt Tackle, Wild Charge
- **Fire moves**: Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Flare Blitz, Fire Punch
- **Ice moves**: Ice Beam, Blizzard, Ice Punch, Icicle Crash

### Counters and Limitations
- **Status immunity**: Electric Terrain prevents paralysis, etc.
- **Type immunities**: Ground types immune to Electric moves
- **Substitute**: Blocks the ability entirely
- **Same-type restriction**: Normal, Fighting, etc. moves don't trigger
- **Multi-hit dilution**: Low chance per hit on multi-hit moves
- **Already statused**: Can't inflict status on already statused targets

### Common Users
Typically found on Pokemon with:
- Mixed offensive stats and diverse move pools
- Electric/Fire/Ice type coverage moves
- Roles as wallbreakers or revenge killers
- High attack frequency to maximize proc chances

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Wallbreaking**: Status effects help break through defensive cores
- **Speed control**: Paralysis provides team speed control
- **Chip damage**: Burn and frostbite provide residual damage
- **Prediction reward**: Forces switches when status is threatened
- **Setup disruption**: Status can interrupt opponent setup attempts

### Ability Interactions
- **Guts**: Opponent benefits from burn (Attack boost)
- **Quick Feet**: Opponent benefits from paralysis/burn (Speed boost)
- **Magic Guard**: Opponent immune to burn/frostbite damage
- **Limber**: Opponent immune to paralysis
- **Water Veil**: Opponent immune to burn

### Team Building Considerations
- **Move diversity**: Maximize type coverage across Electric/Fire/Ice
- **Entry hazard support**: Chip damage stacks with status effects
- **Pivoting support**: U-turn/Volt Switch to maintain momentum
- **Speed tiers**: Consider paralysis for speed control needs
- **Stallbreaking**: Burn helps wear down defensive teams

### Version History
- Elite Redux exclusive ability
- Part of the expanded ability roster
- Designed to reward type diversity in movesets
- Balanced at 20% to avoid being oppressive

### Notable Interactions
- **Thunder Wave vs Elemental Charge paralysis**: Same effect, different source
- **Will-O-Wisp vs Elemental Charge burn**: Same effect, different trigger
- **Flame Orb/Toxic Orb**: Status item users unaffected by same status
- **Rest**: Can cure self-inflicted status from ability
- **Aromatherapy/Heal Bell**: Team can cure status inflicted by ability
