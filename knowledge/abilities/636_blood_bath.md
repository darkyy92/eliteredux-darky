# Blood Bath

Blood Bath provides complete immunity to the bleeding status condition while turning the bearer into a fearsome predator. When this Pok√©mon successfully inflicts bleeding on an opponent that isn't already feared, it automatically triggers terror in that target, causing the Fear status. This creates a deadly synergy where bleeding attacks become psychological warfare tools, potentially disrupting the opponent's strategy through fear-induced limitations on their available moves and battle options.
