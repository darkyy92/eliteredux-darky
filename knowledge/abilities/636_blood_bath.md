Blood Bath provides complete immunity to the bleeding status condition while turning the bearer into a fearsome predator. When this Pokemon successfully inflicts bleeding on an opponent that isn't already feared, it automatically triggers terror in that target, causing the Fear status.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Blood Bath transforms bleeding attacks into psychological warfare tools, combining status immunity with fear-inducing capabilities.
