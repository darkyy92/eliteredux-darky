# Lunar Affinity - Ability ID 711

## In-Game Description
"Copies lunar moves used by others."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Lunar Affinity automatically copies and uses lunar moves when other Pokémon use them in battle. Triggers on Moonlight, Moonblast, Lunar Dance, and Lunar Blessing. The copied move uses the original user's stats and targets but is performed by this Pokémon immediately afterwards.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Lunar Affinity is a reactive ability that automatically copies and executes lunar-typed moves when used by any Pokémon in battle. The ability activates through the `onCopyMove` trigger, checking if the move has the `lunar` property set to true.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move requirement**: The move must have `lunar: true` in its data
- **Timing**: Activates immediately after another Pokémon uses a lunar move
- **User independence**: Can copy moves from allies or opponents
- **No PP cost**: The copied move doesn't consume PP from the Lunar Affinity user

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability LunarAffinity = {
    .onCopyMove = +[](ON_COPY_MOVE) -> int {
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].lunar)
        return UseOutOfTurnAttack(battler, target, ability, move, 0);
    },
};
```

### Lunar Moves in Elite Redux
The following moves trigger Lunar Affinity:
- **Moonlight**: Healing move that restores HP
- **Moonblast**: Fairy-type special attack with 20% chance to lower Special Attack
- **Lunar Dance**: Self-sacrifice move that fully heals the next Pokémon
- **Lunar Blessing**: Status move that provides beneficial effects

### Important Interactions
- **Out-of-turn execution**: Uses `UseOutOfTurnAttack` so it doesn't wait for turn order
- **Original stats**: The copied move uses the original user's offensive stats
- **Targeting**: Maintains the same target as the original move
- **No ability interaction**: The copy bypasses normal ability interactions
- **Status effects**: Copy isn't affected by the user's status conditions like paralysis

### Strategic Implications
- **Moonlight synergy**: Double healing when allies use Moonlight
- **Offensive copying**: Can copy powerful Moonblast attacks for extra damage
- **Support multiplication**: Copying Lunar Blessing multiplies support effects
- **Unpredictable timing**: Opponents can't predict when lunar moves will be copied

### Common Users
Based on the proto data, Lunar Affinity appears on:
- Pokémon in the "Lunar" category
- Certain Fairy-type and Psychic-type Pokémon
- Pokémon with celestial or moon-based themes

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Double utility**: Turns opponent's lunar moves into advantages
- **Team support**: Amplifies ally lunar move effects
- **No resource cost**: Free move copying without PP expenditure
- **Timing advantage**: Out-of-turn activation can break prediction
- **Limited pool**: Only works with lunar-flagged moves

### Counters
- **Avoid lunar moves**: Don't use lunar moves against Lunar Affinity users
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas disable copying
- **Priority moves**: Fast moves can interrupt before copy triggers
- **Switching**: Remove the Lunar Affinity user from battle
- **Non-lunar alternatives**: Use non-lunar healing/support moves instead

### Synergies
- **Lunar move users**: Team with Pokémon that know lunar moves
- **Moonlight/Lunar Blessing**: Copy healing and support moves
- **Fairy-type teams**: Many Fairy-types learn Moonblast
- **Doubles/Triples**: More opportunities for lunar move copying
- **Weather teams**: Some lunar moves benefit from weather conditions

### Version History
- Custom ability in Elite Redux
- Part of the expanded lunar move system
- Unique reactive copying mechanic
- No equivalent in official Pokémon games
