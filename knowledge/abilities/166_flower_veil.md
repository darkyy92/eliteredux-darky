# Flower Veil - Ability ID 166

## In-Game Description
"Protects Grass-type allies from status and stat drops."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Surrounds Grass-type allies with a protective veil of petals, preventing all status conditions including poison, burn, paralysis, sleep, and freeze. Also blocks all stat reductions from enemy moves, abilities, and effects. Does not protect the user if they are not Grass-type.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Flower Veil is a protective ability that shields Grass-type allies from harmful status conditions and stat reductions. This ability was introduced in Generation VI and provides comprehensive battlefield protection for Grass-type teammates.

### Status Protection
- Prevents ALL status conditions (poison, burn, paralysis, sleep, freeze, confusion) from affecting Grass-type allies
- Works against both direct status moves and secondary status effects from damaging moves
- Applies through `onStatusImmune` callback in the battle engine

### Stat Reduction Protection  
- Blocks ALL stat decreases to Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion
- Protects against moves like Intimidate, stat-lowering moves, and ability-based stat drops
- Handled through `IsFlowerVeilProtected()` function in battle script commands
- Displays "surrounded itself with a veil of petals!" message when activated

### Application Rules
- **Target:** Only affects Grass-type Pokemon on the same side as the ability user
- **Self-Protection:** Does NOT protect the user unless they are also Grass-type
- **Breakable:** Can be bypassed by Mold Breaker and similar abilities
- **Activation:** Works passively - no turn activation required

## Implementation Details

### Code Location
- **Primary Definition:** `src/abilities.cc` lines 1840-1848 (`FlowerVeil` struct)
- **Status Immunity:** Uses `onStatusImmune` callback with `APPLY_ON_ALLY` flag
- **Stat Protection:** Handled in `src/battle_script_commands.c` via `IsFlowerVeilProtected()`
- **Battle Message:** "surrounded itself with a veil of petals!" in `battle_message.c`

### Ability Structure
```cpp
constexpr Ability FlowerVeil = {
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_STATUS1)
        CHECK(IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE(target, TYPE_GRASS))
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onStatusImmuneFor = APPLY_ON_ALLY,
    .breakable = TRUE,
};
```

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Protection:** Covers both status and stat reduction immunity
2. **Team Support:** Excellent for protecting Grass-type teammates in doubles
3. **Consistent Activation:** Works passively without setup requirements
4. **Wide Coverage:** Protects against many common battle strategies

### Weaknesses
1. **Type Restriction:** Only protects Grass-type Pokemon
2. **Breakable:** Countered by Mold Breaker abilities
3. **No Self-Protection:** Doesn't help non-Grass-type users
4. **Situational:** Less valuable in singles or non-Grass teams

### Strategic Use
- **Doubles Support:** Ideal for protecting valuable Grass-type attackers
- **Status Immunity:** Counters common status strategies like Spore or Will-O-Wisp
- **Anti-Intimidate:** Protects physical Grass attackers from Attack drops
- **Team Synergy:** Works well with powerful but fragile Grass-type sweepers

## Related Abilities
- **Aroma Veil:** Protects team from move restriction (Taunt, Encore, etc.)
- **Sweet Veil:** Prevents sleep status for entire team
- **Jungle's Guard:** Custom ability that combines Flower Veil with Leaf Guard effects

- **Context:** Displayed when stat reduction or status condition is blocked

## Version History
- **Generation VI:** Introduced as signature ability of Florges line
- **Elite Redux:** Enhanced with comprehensive stat reduction immunity
- **Current:** Functions as both status and stat protection for Grass allies

## Notes
- The ability checks for `TYPE_GRASS` using `IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE()` macro
- Status immunity uses the standard `CHECK_STATUS1` flag system
- Stat protection integrates with the broader stat modification system
- Battle scripts handle both the immunity check and message display
- Works in both singles and doubles, but most effective in team formats
