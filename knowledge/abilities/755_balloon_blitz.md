# Balloon Blitz - Ability ID 755

## In-Game Description
"Inflatable + Hyper Aggressive."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Combines Inflatable and Hyper Aggressive effects. When hit by Fire or Flying moves, boosts Defense and Special Defense by one stage each. Additionally, all moves strike twice, with the second hit dealing 25% damage. Perfect for aggressive tanks that capitalize on defensive boosts.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Dual Ability**: Combines the effects of Inflatable and Hyper Aggressive abilities
- **Inflatable Component**: Raises Defense and Special Defense by +1 when hit by Fire or Flying moves
- **Hyper Aggressive Component**: All moves hit twice, with second hit at 25% power
- **Activation**: Both effects work independently and simultaneously

### Activation Conditions

#### Inflatable Component
- Must be hit by a Fire-type or Flying-type move
- The move must successfully hit (doesn't activate on miss)
- At least one of Defense or Special Defense must be below maximum (+6 stages)
- Uses `ShouldApplyOnHitAffect()` check (blocked by Substitute, etc.)

#### Hyper Aggressive Component  
- Activates on all offensive moves used by the Pokemon
- Transforms single-hit moves into two-hit moves
- Second hit deals exactly 25% of the first hit's damage
- Works with physical, special, and status moves that deal damage

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability BalloonBlitz = {
    .onDefender = Inflatable.onDefender,
    .onParentalBond = ParentalBond.onParentalBond,
};

// Referenced abilities:
constexpr Ability Inflatable = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_DEF) || CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_SPDEF))
        CHECK(moveType == TYPE_FIRE || moveType == TYPE_FLYING);
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_InflatableActivates);
        gBattleScripting.battler = battler;
        return TRUE;
    },
};

constexpr Ability ParentalBond = {
    .onParentalBond = +[](ON_PARENTAL_BOND) -> MultihitType { 
        return PARENTAL_BOND_HYPER_AGGRESSIVE; 
    },
    .resistsFortKnox = TRUE,
};
```

### Multi-Hit Mechanics
```cpp
// Hit count determination
case PARENTAL_BOND_HYPER_AGGRESSIVE:
    return 2; // Always hits exactly twice

// Damage multiplier for second hit
case PARENTAL_BOND_HYPER_AGGRESSIVE:
    REQUIRE(turn) // Only applies to second hit (turn = 1)
    return UQ_4_12(0.25); // 25% damage
```

### Detailed Battle Flow

#### Offensive Turn (Hyper Aggressive)
1. **First Hit**: Full damage calculation and effects
2. **Second Hit**: 25% of first hit's base damage
3. **Secondary Effects**: Only apply once (from first hit)
4. **Critical Hits**: Calculated separately for each hit
5. **Type Effectiveness**: Applied to both hits independently

#### Defensive Turn (Inflatable)
1. **Take Damage**: From Fire/Flying move
2. **Check Conditions**: Valid hit, stat boost possible
3. **Stat Boosts**: +1 Defense and +1 Special Defense
4. **Animation**: Defensive stat boost animation plays
5. **Message**: "Balloon Blitz raised [Pokemon's] Defense and Special Defense!"

### Affected Move Types (Inflatable Component)

**Fire-type moves that trigger Inflatable**:
- Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Overheat, Heat Wave
- Will-O-Wisp, Flame Wheel, Fire Punch
- Sacred Fire, Blue Flare, V-create
- Any Fire-type move, including status moves

**Flying-type moves that trigger Inflatable**:
- Wing Attack, Air Slash, Hurricane, Brave Bird
- Roost, Tailwind, Defog (if Flying-type)
- Aeroblast, Air Cutter, Gust
- Any Flying-type move, including status moves

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics

#### Inflatable Interactions
- **Substitute**: Blocks Inflatable activation
- **Magic Bounce**: Cannot be triggered by bounced moves
- **Stat Stage Limits**: Each stat only raised if below +6
- **Mold Breaker**: Does not affect Inflatable (defensive ability)
- **Multi-hit moves**: Activates only once per turn

#### Hyper Aggressive Interactions
- **Skill Link**: Does not extend hits beyond 2
- **Rock Blast/Bullet Seed**: Still only hits twice total
- **King's Rock/Razor Fang**: Flinch chance applies to both hits
- **Life Orb**: Recoil damage applies after both hits
- **Contact moves**: Both hits make contact if applicable
- **Abilities triggered on hit**: Can activate from either hit

### Strategic Implications

#### Offensive Strategy
- **Damage Output**: Effectively 125% damage on all moves (100% + 25%)
- **Breaking Substitutes**: Two hits can break Substitute and damage
- **Focus Sash/Sturdy**: Second hit can KO after first hit triggers
- **Multi-hit synergy**: Works with items and abilities that benefit from multiple hits

#### Defensive Strategy  
- **Fire/Flying Immunity**: Turns weakness into strength with stat boosts
- **Setup Opportunities**: Defensive boosts enable further setup
- **Pivot Strategy**: Switch into predicted Fire/Flying moves
- **Bulk Building**: Each successful trigger increases survivability

### Example Damage Calculations

#### Hyper Aggressive Damage
**Balloon Blitz Flamethrower vs Standard Target**:
- First hit: 90 BP (normal damage)
- Second hit: 22.5 BP (25% of 90)
- Total effective power: 112.5 BP per Flamethrower

#### Inflatable Defense Boost
**Before Inflatable (+0 Def)**:
- Talonflame Flare Blitz vs Balloon Blitz user: ~60% damage

**After Inflatable (+1 Def)**:
- Same attack: ~45% damage (25% reduction)

### Common Users
Balloon Blitz is a unique combination ability that would be extremely powerful, likely restricted to:
- **Legendary/Mythical Pokemon**: Due to the power of combining two strong abilities
- **Special Event Pokemon**: Limited distribution due to competitive balance
- **Mega Evolution exclusive**: Where the powerful combination justifies Mega status

### Competitive Usage Notes

#### Strengths
- **Versatile**: Strong on both offense and defense
- **Damage Output**: 125% effective damage on all moves
- **Defensive Recovery**: Turns Fire/Flying attacks into stat boosts
- **Breaking Power**: Two hits bypass many defensive strategies
- **Setup Potential**: Defensive boosts create setup opportunities

#### Weaknesses
- **Overpowered Nature**: Likely banned in most competitive formats
- **Limited Distribution**: Probably restricted to very few Pokemon
- **Prediction Required**: Inflatable requires switching into specific move types
- **Status Moves**: Hyper Aggressive doesn't boost non-damaging moves

### Counters

#### Against Hyper Aggressive Component
- **Rocky Helmet**: Damages on both hits if contact moves
- **Rough Skin/Iron Barbs**: Double contact damage
- **Flame Body/Static**: Double chance for status on contact
- **Substitute**: Can potentially waste both hits

#### Against Inflatable Component
- **Non-Fire/Flying moves**: Avoid triggering the defensive boosts
- **Taunt**: Prevents setup after stat boosts
- **Haze/Clear Smog**: Removes stat boosts immediately
- **Status moves**: Don't trigger Inflatable

### Synergies

#### With Hyper Aggressive
- **King's Rock/Razor Fang**: Double flinch chances
- **Life Orb**: Boosted damage on both hits
- **Choice items**: Both hits benefit from choice boost
- **Skill Link**: No effect (ability caps at 2 hits)

#### With Inflatable
- **Stored Power**: Benefits from defensive stat boosts
- **Body Press**: Defense boosts increase offensive power
- **Weakness Policy**: Fire/Flying weakness becomes beneficial
- **Leftovers/Recovery**: Defensive bulk helps with healing

### Version History
- Introduced in Elite Redux as a unique combination ability
- Designed as an extremely powerful ability for special/legendary Pokemon
- Combines two popular ability effects into one overpowered package
- Likely restricted due to competitive balance concerns

### Balance Considerations
This ability is intentionally overpowered, combining two strong individual abilities:
- **Power Level**: Far exceeds typical ability strength
- **Competitive Impact**: Would dominate most formats if widely available
- **Design Intent**: Meant for special, limited-distribution Pokemon
- **Restriction Necessity**: Likely requires usage bans in competitive play
