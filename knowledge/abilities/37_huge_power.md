# Huge Power - Ability ID 37

## In-Game Description
"Doubles own Attack stat. Boosts raw stat, not base stat."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Huge Power doubles the Pokémon's Attack stat before stat stage modifiers are applied. This multiplies the effective Attack by 2.0x, making physical moves significantly more powerful. Works with stat stages, items, and other modifiers that are applied after. Identical effect to Pure Power.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**HUGE POWER** is a stat-modifying ability that provides a massive boost to physical offensive power.

### Stat Modification Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: Applied during stat calculation (onStat hook)
- **Effect**: Multiplies Attack stat by 2.0 before other modifiers
- **Application Order**: Base stat → Huge Power → stat stages → items/other effects
- **Stat Type**: Only affects STAT_ATK (Attack), no other stats modified

### Calculation Order:
1. **Base Attack stat** (from species data)
2. **Huge Power multiplication** (×2.0)
3. **Stat stage modifiers** (+1 Attack = ×1.5, etc.)
4. **Item effects** (Choice Band, Life Orb, etc.)
5. **Other ability effects** (Guts, Hustle damage multiplier, etc.)

### Key Interactions:
- **vs Hustle**: Huge Power affects raw stat calculation, Hustle affects damage multiplier. Both stack multiplicatively
- **vs Choice Band**: Huge Power doubles the stat, Choice Band multiplies damage by 1.5x. Stack multiplicatively
- **vs Stat Stages**: Attack boosts (+1, +2, etc.) apply after Huge Power doubling
- **vs Burn**: Burn's Attack reduction applies to the doubled stat, so still deals significant damage

### Ability Relationships:
- **Pure Power (ID 74)**: Functionally identical ability with same effect
- **Both abilities share code**: `PurePower.onStat = HugePower.onStat`
- **AI Rating**: Valued at 10 (maximum priority) by battle AI

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability HugePower = {
    .onStat =
        +[](ON_STAT) {
            if (statId == STAT_ATK) *stat *= 2;
        },
};
```

### Pokémon Distribution in Elite Redux:
- **As Main Ability**: Various Pokémon including select legendaries
- **As Innate Ability**: Common on physical attackers across multiple evolution lines
- **Notable Users**: Azumarill line, Mawile, and many custom Elite Redux Pokémon
- **Pure Power Users**: Meditite/Medicham line (functionally identical)

### Competitive Analysis:
- **Power Level**: Extremely high - effectively doubles physical damage output
- **Synergy**: Exceptional with high base Attack stats and physical movesets
- **Counters**: Status moves (burn), defensive abilities, switching tactics
- **Team Role**: Enables frail Pokémon to become physical powerhouses

### Common Misconceptions:
- **NOT a damage multiplier**: Affects the stat itself, not final damage calculation
- **Works with all physical moves**: Unlike some abilities, has no move restrictions
- **Stacks with everything**: Since it modifies the base stat, it multiplies with all other effects
- **Not affected by Mold Breaker**: Stat modifications cannot be suppressed

### Strategic Applications:
1. **Sweeper Setup**: Combined with stat boosts, creates overwhelming physical presence
2. **Pivot Utility**: High Attack makes even resisted moves threatening
3. **Item Synergy**: Choice Band/Life Orb become incredibly potent
4. **Priority Moves**: Makes priority attacks hit like full-power moves

### Version History:
- **Gen 3**: Introduced on Azurill/Azumarill and Meditite/Medicham
- **Elite Redux**: Expanded to numerous Pokémon as both main and innate ability
- **Implementation**: Uses modern callback system with precise stat timing
