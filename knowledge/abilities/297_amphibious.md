# Amphibious - Ability ID 297

## In-Game Description
"Water moves gain STAB. Can't become drenched."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Grants STAB to all Water-type moves regardless of the user's typing, multiplying their power by 1.5x. Also provides immunity to being drenched by Venom Drench, preventing the Attack, Special Attack, and Speed reductions that occur when poisoned Pokemon are hit by that move.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **STAB Grant**: All Water-type moves used by this Pokemon receive Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB), multiplying their power by 1.5x regardless of the user's actual typing
- **Drench Immunity**: Complete immunity to the "drenched" status condition inflicted by Venom Drench

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Amphibious = {
    .onStab = +[](ON_STAB) -> int { return moveType == TYPE_WATER; },
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_DRENCH)
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### STAB Mechanics
- Applies the standard 1.5x power multiplier to Water moves
- Functions identically to natural STAB from Pokemon's actual typing
- Stacks additively with other damage bonuses (items, weather, etc.)
- Does not interfere with the Pokemon's natural STAB from their actual types

### Drench Immunity Details
- **Venom Drench**: A Poison-type status move that targets both foes, requiring the target to be poisoned
- **Drench Effect**: Reduces Attack, Special Attack, and Speed by 1 stage each when successfully applied
- **Immunity Scope**: Complete immunity to the stat reductions; the move will fail against Amphibious users

### Activation Conditions
- **STAB**: Automatically applies to any Water-type move used by the Pokemon
- **Immunity**: Automatically prevents drench status when targeted by Venom Drench

### Common Users
- **Eiscue (No Ice Face form)**: Ice-type Pokemon that gains Water STAB
- **Various Water/Poison types**: Natural synergy with Water moves and poison immunity themes
- **Mixed-type Pokemon**: Non-Water types that benefit from Water move coverage

### Strategic Applications
- **Coverage Expansion**: Allows non-Water types to use Water moves effectively
- **Offensive Versatility**: 1.5x boost makes Water moves viable attacking options
- **Status Immunity**: Protection against specific stat reduction strategies
- **Team Role Flexibility**: Enables Pokemon to fill Water-type offensive roles regardless of typing

### Competitive Analysis
**Strengths:**
- Immediate power boost to all Water moves
- Expands movepool viability for non-Water types  
- Specific but valuable status immunity
- No activation requirements or conditions

**Limitations:**
- Only affects Water-type moves
- Drench immunity is highly situational
- Doesn't provide defensive benefits beyond one status
- Requires good Water move coverage to be effective

### Damage Calculations
```
Base Water Move Power x 1.5 (STAB) x Other Modifiers = Final Power

Example: Hydro Pump (110 BP)
- Without Amphibious: 110 BP
- With Amphibious: 110 x 1.5 = 165 BP effective power
```

### Interactions
- **Other STAB**: Stacks with natural STAB if Pokemon is already Water-type (1.5x x 1.5x = 2.25x total)
- **Abilities**: Works with other damage-boosting abilities (Tough Claws, Sheer Force, etc.)
- **Items**: Stacks with type-boosting items like Mystic Water
- **Weather**: Combines with Rain's Water move boost for massive damage

### Counters
- **Type Resistances**: Steel, Water, Grass, and Dragon types resist Water moves
- **Abilities**: Water Absorb, Storm Drain, Dry Skin negate Water attacks entirely
- **Non-Water Movesets**: Ability provides no benefit if Pokemon lacks Water moves

### Synergies
- **Rain Teams**: Excellent synergy with Rain Dance for 1.5x + 1.5x = 2.25x Water move power
- **Mixed Attackers**: Allows physical or special Water moves to hit hard
- **Coverage Moves**: Surf, Scald, Hydro Pump become viable on any Pokemon
- **Poison Types**: Natural thematic fit with drench immunity

### Version History
- Added as part of Elite Redux's expanded ability system
- Designed to provide Water-type offensive capability to non-Water Pokemon
- Drench immunity added as a thematic bonus fitting the "amphibious" concept
