Horn moves become special and deal 30% more damage. Converts physical horn attacks (Horn Attack, Megahorn, Smart Strike) to special moves using SpAtk. Creates mixed attacker threats that bypass high Defense. Megahorn becomes 156 BP special Bug nuke. Horn Leech provides special Grass recovery.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**ENERGIZED HORNS** (displayed as "Energy Horns" in-game) is a move conversion ability that transforms physical horn-based moves into special attacks while providing substantial damage amplification.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Damage Multiplier**: 1.3x (30% boost) to all horn-based moves
- **Move Conversion**: Changes physical horn moves to special category
- **Stat Usage**: Converted moves use Special Attack and target Special Defense
- **Move Detection**: Checks for `hornBased` flag on moves

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability EnergizedHorns = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = MightyHorn.onOffensiveMultiplier,  // 30% damage boost
    .onSwapSplit = +[](ON_SWAP_SPLIT) -> int {
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].split == SPLIT_PHYSICAL)
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].hornBased);
        return TRUE;  // Makes the move special
    },
};
```

### Horn-Based Moves in Elite Redux:
**Standard Horn Moves:**
- **Horn Attack** - Normal, 65 BP
- **Megahorn** - Bug, 120 BP, 85% accuracy
- **Horn Drill** - Normal, OHKO move
- **Smart Strike** - Steel, 70 BP, never misses
- **Horn Leech** - Grass, 75 BP, heals 50% damage dealt

**Potential Custom Horn Moves:**
Elite Redux may include additional horn-based moves marked with the `hornBased` flag

### Strategic Implications:
1. **Mixed Attacker Creation**: Physical horn users become special threats
2. **Wall Breaking**: Bypasses high Defense Pokemon like Skarmory, Forretress
3. **Type Coverage**: Horn moves span Normal, Bug, Steel, and Grass types
4. **STAB Synergy**: Bug-types with Megahorn get special Bug STAB

### Damage Calculations:
**Example: Heracross with Energized Horns** (40 Special Attack normally):
- Regular Megahorn: 120 BP physical (uses 125 Attack)
- Energized Megahorn: 156 BP special (uses 40 Special Attack)

While base SpA is lower, the ability opens new EV spread options and catches opponents off-guard.

### Notable Interactions:
- **Megahorn**: Becomes a 156 BP special Bug nuke
- **Smart Strike**: Never-miss special Steel coverage
- **Horn Leech**: Special Grass move that heals
- **Horn Drill**: OHKO that targets Special Defense (if it connects)

### Ideal Users:
Pokemon that benefit most from Energized Horns:
- Horn users with decent Special Attack
- Mixed attackers wanting to diversify damage types
- Pokemon facing physically defensive metagames
- Bug-types seeking special STAB options

### EV Spread Considerations:
With Energized Horns, horn users can run:
- **Special Attack Investment**: Maximize horn move damage
- **Mixed Spreads**: Both physical and special coverage
- **Bulky Special**: Use defensive investment with special horn attacks

### Example Set:
**Theoretical Horn User @ Life Orb**
- Megahorn (Bug STAB, 156 BP special)
- Smart Strike (Steel coverage, never misses)
- Horn Leech (Grass coverage, recovery)
- [Non-horn coverage move]

### Competitive Usage:
- **Lead Breaker**: Surprise special damage on typical physical walls
- **Stallbreaker**: Horn Leech provides recovery while dealing special damage
- **Weather Teams**: No weather dependency, consistent damage
- **Anti-Meta**: Counters Defense-stacking strategies

### Counters:
- High Special Defense walls (Blissey, Chansey)
- Resist-heavy typings against horn moves
- Faster special attackers
- Fort Knox ability blocks the damage boost

### Synergies:
- **Mighty Horn**: Would stack if Pokemon had both abilities
- **Special Attack Boosts**: Nasty Plot, Work Up enhance horn damage
- **Screens Support**: Light Screen more valuable than Reflect
- **Trick Room**: Slower horn users become special threats

### Comparison to Similar Abilities:
- **Mighty Horn**: Same boost but keeps moves physical
- **Magical Fists**: Converts punches to special
- **Mythical Arrows**: Converts arrows to special
- **Mystic Blades**: Converts slashes to special

### Version History:
- Elite Redux exclusive ability
- Part of the "physical-to-special" ability family
- Designed to create unique offensive dynamics with horn moves
- Name displays as "Energy Horns" in-game but coded as "EnergizedHorns"
