# Sand Guard - Ability ID 482

## In-Game Description
"Blocks priority and reduces special damage by 1/2 in sand."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Sand Guard blocks priority moves and reduces special attack damage by 50% during sandstorm weather. Works with all sandstorm forms including Sand Stream. Priority blocking protects user and allies, while damage reduction applies only to special moves targeting the user in sandstorm weather.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Sand Guard is a dual-defensive ability that provides both priority move immunity and special damage reduction during sandstorm weather. The ability has two distinct effects that operate under different conditions.

### Priority Move Blocking
- **Weather requirement**: Sandstorm must be active to block priority moves
- **Effect**: Completely blocks all priority moves (priority > 0) from opponents
- **Range**: Protects both the user and allied Pokemon (onImmuneFor = APPLY_ON_ALLY)
- **Mechanism**: Uses the same priority blocking system as Queenly Majesty and Dazzling
- **Message**: Shows "Dazzling" protection message when blocking

### Special Damage Reduction
- **Weather requirement**: Sandstorm must be active for damage reduction
- **Attacker condition**: The attacking Pokemon must be affected by sandstorm
- **Move type**: Only applies to special attacks (IS_MOVE_SPECIAL)
- **Damage reduction**: Multiplies incoming special damage by 0.5 (50% reduction)
- **Target**: Only applies to the Sand Guard user, not allies

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability SandGuard = {
    .onImmune = +[](ON_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(IsBattlerWeatherAffected(battler, WEATHER_SANDSTORM_ANY));
        return QueenlyMajesty.onImmune(DELEGATE_IMMUNE);
    },
    .onDefensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_DEFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            if (IS_MOVE_SPECIAL(move) && IsBattlerWeatherAffected(attacker, WEATHER_SANDSTORM_ANY)) MUL(.5);
        },
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .sandImmune = TRUE,
};
```

### Weather Conditions
Sand Guard activates under any sandstorm weather:
- **Regular sandstorm** (from Sandstorm move)
- **Sand Stream** (from Tyranitar, Hippowdon, etc.)
- **Sand Spit** (triggered by contact moves)
- **WEATHER_SANDSTORM_ANY** covers all sandstorm variants

### Important Interactions
- **Sandstorm immunity**: User is immune to sandstorm damage (sandImmune = TRUE)
- **Ability suppression**: Both effects are disabled by abilities like Mold Breaker (breakable = TRUE)
- **Priority bypass**: Abilities like Triage or Prankster still have their priority moves blocked
- **Physical moves**: No damage reduction against physical attacks
- **Status moves**: Priority status moves are still blocked even if they don't deal damage

### Priority Move Examples Blocked
- Aqua Jet, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch (physical priority)
- Vacuum Wave, Water Shuriken (special priority)
- Prankster-boosted status moves
- Quick Attack, Extremespeed
- Fake Out, Sucker Punch

### Special Damage Reduction Examples
- **Blocked**: Hydro Pump from Pokemon in sandstorm (50% damage)
- **Not blocked**: Earthquake from Pokemon in sandstorm (physical move)
- **Not blocked**: Surf from Pokemon not in sandstorm (clear weather)
- **Blocked**: Thunderbolt from Garchomp with Sand Stream active

### Strategic Implications
- **Sandstorm team synergy**: Essential for sand-based teams
- **Priority immunity**: Protects against common priority revenge killers
- **Special tank**: Excellent special bulk in sandstorm conditions
- **Weather dependent**: Completely ineffective without sandstorm
- **Dual protection**: Covers both offensive pressure and priority threats

### Competitive Usage
- **Sand core**: Pairs well with Sand Stream setters like Tyranitar/Hippowdon
- **Defensive pivot**: Can switch into special attackers and priority users
- **Weather support**: Maintains sand for team while providing utility
- **Anti-priority**: Shuts down common priority-based strategies
- **Tank role**: Functions as special wall in sandstorm teams

### Common Users
Sand Guard is a custom Elite Redux ability, so usage depends on which Pokemon receive it:
- Likely Ground/Rock/Steel types that fit sandstorm teams
- Pokemon that naturally benefit from sandstorm conditions
- Defensive Pokemon that can utilize both protective effects

### Synergies
- **Sand Stream/Sand Spit**: Essential weather setters
- **Sand Rush/Sand Force**: Other sand-based abilities
- **Rock-type moves**: Boosted accuracy in sandstorm
- **Leftovers/Rocky Helmet**: Defensive item synergy
- **Sand Veil**: Evasion boost stacking with damage reduction

### Counters
- **Weather override**: Changing weather disables both effects completely
- **Cloud Nine/Air Lock**: Negates sandstorm effects
- **Physical attackers**: Bypass special damage reduction
- **Mold Breaker family**: Ignore the ability entirely
- **Weather-immune moves**: Some moves ignore weather conditions

### Comparison to Similar Abilities
- **Queenly Majesty**: Same priority blocking but no damage reduction
- **Ice Scales**: Same special damage reduction but no priority blocking
- **Fur Coat**: Physical damage reduction instead of special
- **Dazzling**: Priority blocking for ally but no personal benefits

### Elite Redux Context
In Elite Redux's 4-ability system, Sand Guard can function as either:
- **Changeable ability**: Switchable based on team needs
- **Innate ability**: Always active for consistent sand team support
- The dual nature makes it valuable in both roles
