# Earth Eater - Ability ID 450

## In-Game Description
"Heals 25% of max HP when hit by a Ground move."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Earth Eater heals the Pokemon for 25% of its maximum HP when hit by Ground-type moves. This includes all Ground attacks like Earthquake, Earth Power, and Drill Run. The healing occurs instead of taking damage, making the user immune to Ground moves while gaining recovery.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Earth Eater is a defensive absorption ability that converts Ground-type damage into healing. When the Pokemon with Earth Eater is targeted by a Ground-type move, instead of taking damage, it recovers 25% of its maximum HP.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move type requirement**: The attacking move must be Ground-type
- **Damage nullification**: The move deals 0 damage regardless of power
- **Healing amount**: Restores exactly 25% of maximum HP (rounded down, minimum 1 HP)
- **HP cap**: Cannot heal above maximum HP
- **Healing restriction**: Only heals if the Pokemon can be healed (not affected by Heal Block)

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability EarthEater = {
    .onAbsorb = +[](ON_ABSORB) -> int {
        CHECK(moveType == TYPE_GROUND)
        return ABSORB_RESULT_HEAL;
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,
};

// In battle_util.c, ABSORB_RESULT_HEAL triggers:
// gBattleMoveDamage = gBattleMons[battler].maxHP / 4; // 25% healing
// gBattleMoveDamage *= -1; // Negative = healing
```

### Ground Moves That Trigger Earth Eater
- **Physical Ground moves**: Earthquake, Drill Run, Bulldoze, Stomping Tantrum
- **Special Ground moves**: Earth Power, Mud Bomb, Scorching Sands
- **Status Ground moves**: Spikes (on entry), Thousand Arrows (even hits Flying types)
- **Multi-hit Ground moves**: Each hit would trigger healing separately
- **Z-Moves and Max Moves**: Ground-type variants are absorbed

### Important Interactions
- **Flying types**: Earth Eater users who are Flying-type still absorb Ground moves
- **Levitate interaction**: If a Pokemon has both, Earth Eater takes priority
- **Ability suppression**: Doesn't work if ability is suppressed by Mold Breaker variants
- **Substitute**: Ground moves hitting Substitute don't trigger Earth Eater
- **Magic Bounce**: Reflected Ground moves don't trigger the original user's Earth Eater

### Damage Calculation Override
- **Power independence**: Healing is always 25% regardless of move power
- **Critical hits**: Don't affect healing amount
- **STAB/effectiveness**: Completely irrelevant as no damage is dealt
- **Stat stages**: Attack/Defense stats don't matter for healing calculation

### Strategic Implications
- **Ground immunity**: Provides complete immunity to the most common offensive type
- **Earthquake synergy**: Teammates can use Earthquake freely
- **Pivot potential**: Can switch into predicted Ground moves for free healing
- **Longevity**: Provides reliable recovery against Ground-type attackers
- **Sandstorm teams**: Excellent on sand teams where Ground moves are common

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Tier placement**: Extremely valuable ability due to Ground's offensive prevalence
- **Team support**: Allows safe Earthquake usage by teammates
- **Wallbreaker check**: Can wall many Ground-type wallbreakers
- **Hazard immunity**: Doesn't protect against Spikes/Stealth Rock
- **Versatile defensive tool**: Works against both physical and special Ground attacks

### Counters and Limitations
- **Non-Ground coverage**: Vulnerable to all other attacking types
- **Mold Breaker**: Neutralizing Gas, Mold Breaker, and similar bypass the ability
- **Heal Block**: Prevents the healing aspect while still negating damage
- **Status moves**: Doesn't provide status immunity
- **Max HP users**: Less valuable healing on high HP Pokemon

### Synergies
- **Earthquake teammates**: Can use Earthquake without friendly fire
- **Sand teams**: Common Ground move usage makes ability valuable
- **Pivot strategies**: Safe switching on predicted Ground moves
- **Leftovers/recovery**: Stacks with other healing for extreme longevity
- **Assault Vest**: Can run offensive sets while maintaining defensive utility

### Pokemon That Learn Earth Eater
Earth Eater is typically found on:
- Ground-type Pokemon as a defensive option
- Bulky Pokemon that appreciate the immunity and healing
- Pokemon designed to counter Ground-type threats
- Rock/Steel types vulnerable to Ground coverage

### Version History
- Custom ability in Elite Redux
- Similar to existing absorption abilities (Water Absorb, Volt Absorb)
- Designed to provide Ground-type immunity with healing benefit
- Part of the expanded ability system in Elite Redux

### Ability Comparison
- **Water/Volt/Fire Absorb**: Same healing mechanism, different types
- **Levitate**: Provides Ground immunity but no healing
- **Flash Fire**: Boosts Fire moves instead of healing
- **Sap Sipper**: Grass absorption with Attack boost instead of healing
