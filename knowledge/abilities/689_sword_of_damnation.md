## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Reduces the Defense stat of every other Pokemon by 25% while the user is out. Multiples of the same Ruin ability does not stack together. Ignores all the foes' stat stage changes during damage calculations.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Game Mechanics
- Reduces opposing Pokemon's Defense stat by 25% (multiplicative: Defense x 0.75)
- Ignores stat changes when calculating damage dealt and received (Unaware effect)
- Affects all opposing Pokemon while the user is active
- Cannot be suppressed by most ability-nullifying effects

### Strategic Applications
- Excellent for physical attackers wanting to guarantee consistent damage output
- Particularly effective against defensive teams and stat-boosting strategies
- Synergizes well with high Attack Pokemon that can capitalize on the Defense reduction
- Counters both defensive walls and setup sweepers simultaneously

### Pokemon Usage
This ability is typically found on powerful physical attackers with high base Attack stats, allowing them to serve as both offensive threats and team support by weakening the opponent's physical bulk.
