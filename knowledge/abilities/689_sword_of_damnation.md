# Sword of Damnation

**Extended Description:**
This cursed blade combines terrifying power with tactical precision. The weapon's malevolent aura reduces all opposing Pokémon's Defense by 25%, making them vulnerable to physical attacks. Additionally, the wielder fights with singular focus, ignoring all stat changes when calculating damage.

**Game Mechanics:**
- Reduces opposing Pokémon's Defense stat by 25% (multiplicative: Defense × 0.75)
- Ignores stat changes when calculating damage dealt and received (Unaware effect)
- Affects all opposing Pokémon while the user is active
- Cannot be suppressed by most ability-nullifying effects

**Strategic Applications:**
- Excellent for physical attackers wanting to guarantee consistent damage output
- Particularly effective against defensive teams and stat-boosting strategies
- Synergizes well with high Attack Pokémon that can capitalize on the Defense reduction
- Counters both defensive walls and setup sweepers simultaneously

**Pokémon Usage:**
This ability is typically found on powerful physical attackers with high base Attack stats, allowing them to serve as both offensive threats and team support by weakening the opponent's physical bulk.
