# Ole - Ability ID 597

## In-Game Description
"Reduces accuracy of incoming single-target moves by 20%."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Reduces the accuracy of all single-target moves aimed at the user by 20%. Spread moves such as Heat Wave retain normal accuracy.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Ole is a defensive ability that makes the user harder to hit by reducing the accuracy of incoming attacks. Named after the bullfighting dodge technique, it represents the Pokemon's evasive prowess, causing opponents to miss more frequently without requiring setup or stat changes.

### Technical Implementation

### Code Location
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
- **Type**: Accuracy modification ability

### Core Mechanics
```cpp
constexpr Ability Ole = {
    .onAccuracy = +[](ON_ACCURACY) -> AccuracyPriority {
        switch (GetBattlerBattleMoveTargetFlags(move, battler)) {
            case MOVE_TARGET_SELECTED:
            case MOVE_TARGET_USER_OR_SELECTED:
            case MOVE_TARGET_RANDOM:
                *accuracy *= .8;
                return ACCURACY_MULTIPLICATIVE;

            default:
                return ACCURACY_NO_RESULT;
        }
    },
};
```

### Effect Details
- **Accuracy Reduction**: 20% (0.8x multiplier)
- **Affected Moves**:
  - MOVE_TARGET_SELECTED: Standard single-target moves
  - MOVE_TARGET_USER_OR_SELECTED: Moves that can target user or enemy
  - MOVE_TARGET_RANDOM: Randomly targeted moves
- **Not Affected**:
  - Multi-target moves (Earthquake, Surf, etc.)
  - Self-targeting moves
  - Field effects

### Strategic Applications

### Defensive Wall
- Makes the user 20% harder to hit consistently
- Stacks with other evasion boosts
- No setup required for immediate protection
- Forces opponents to rely on less accurate moves

### RNG Manipulation
- Creates miss chances on otherwise reliable moves
- 100% accuracy moves become 80% accurate
- 85% accuracy moves drop to 68%
- 70% accuracy moves fall to 56%

### Stall Tactics
- Combines well with recovery moves
- Wastes opponent PP through misses
- Buys time for status damage
- Frustrates sweep attempts

### Accuracy Mathematics

### Common Move Examples
- **100% Accuracy Moves**: 100% to 80%
  - Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower
- **95% Accuracy Moves**: 95% to 76%
  - Play Rough, Dragon Rush
- **90% Accuracy Moves**: 90% to 72%
  - Hydro Pump, Heat Wave
- **85% Accuracy Moves**: 85% to 68%
  - Fire Blast, Stone Edge
- **80% Accuracy Moves**: 80% to 64%
  - Thunder (outside rain)
- **70% Accuracy Moves**: 70% to 56%
  - Focus Blast, Hurricane (outside rain)

### Multi-Hit Implications
For multi-hit moves, each hit checks accuracy:
- 2-hit moves: 64% chance both hit
- 3-hit moves: 51.2% chance all hit
- 5-hit moves: 32.8% chance all hit

### Synergies and Interactions

### Ability Synergies
- **Sand Veil/Snow Cloak**: Additional evasion in weather
- **Tangled Feet**: More evasion when confused
- **Compound Eyes**: Opponents with this partially offset Ole
- **Hustle**: Makes physical moves even less reliable

### Move Synergies
- **Double Team**: Stacks for extreme evasion
- **Substitute**: Protects while they miss
- **Recover/Roost**: Heal while avoiding damage
- **Toxic**: Stall with poison + evasion

### Item Synergies
- **Bright Powder**: Additional 10% evasion
- **Leftovers**: Sustain through missed attacks
- **Rocky Helmet**: Punish the hits that connect
- **Focus Sash**: Insurance against lucky hits

### Competitive Analysis

### Tier: Medium
Ole provides consistent defensive value without being overpowered or centralizing.

### Strengths
1. **No Setup Required**: Immediate 20% miss chance
2. **Universal Application**: Works on all targeted moves
3. **PP Warfare**: Forces more move uses for KOs
4. **Psychological Factor**: Frustrates opponents

### Weaknesses
1. **RNG Dependent**: Can't guarantee misses
2. **Multi-Target Immunity**: Earthquake/Surf bypass
3. **No Guard**: Completely negated by this ability
4. **Status Moves**: Many still work at full accuracy

### Usage Strategies

### Defensive Pivot
- Switch in to force misses on predicted attacks
- Use miss turns to set up or heal
- Pivot out after forcing switches
- Maintain defensive momentum

### Setup Enabler
- Use missed attacks to set up stat boosts
- Combine with Substitute for safety
- Set hazards during miss turns
- Build win conditions slowly

### Stall Core
- Combine with Toxic for damage over time
- Use Protect to scout and waste PP
- Recover/Roost on predicted misses
- Win through attrition

### Counter Strategies

### Ability Counters
- **No Guard**: Ignores all accuracy/evasion modifiers
- **Compound Eyes**: 30% accuracy boost offsets most of Ole
- **Victory Star**: Team-wide accuracy boost

### Move Counters
- **Multi-Target Moves**: Earthquake, Surf, etc. ignore Ole
- **Never-Miss Moves**: Swift, Aerial Ace, etc.
- **Status Moves**: Many bypass or have high base accuracy
- **Haze**: Removes any additional evasion boosts

### Strategic Counters
- Use high-accuracy moves (100%+ base)
- Switch to special attackers with Surf/Heat Wave
- Set up entry hazards for passive damage
- Use multi-hit moves for more chances

### Conclusion

Ole represents a balanced approach to evasion-based abilities in Elite Redux. Unlike setup-dependent evasion strategies, it provides immediate and consistent value without being overwhelming. The 20% reduction is significant enough to matter in battles but not so high as to be frustrating or uncompetitive.

The ability rewards defensive play and careful positioning while maintaining counterplay through multi-target moves and abilities. Its Medium tier rating reflects its solid utility without game-breaking potential, making it an excellent choice for defensive teams that want to add an element of uncertainty to opponent calculations.
