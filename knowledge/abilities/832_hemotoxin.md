# Hemotoxin - Ability ID 832

## In-Game Description
"Supresses abilities of the target when they're poisoned."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Hemotoxin seeps into poisoned foes, temporarily neutralizing their abilities while they suffer from poison status. The toxic compounds disrupt the target's natural powers, leaving them unable to utilize their ability effects until the poison is cured or they switch out.

*Character count: 289*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Hemotoxin suppresses the abilities of any opposing Pokémon that has a poison status condition, effectively nullifying their ability effects while they remain poisoned.

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Passive effect active at all times
- **Target**: All poisoned opposing Pokémon
- **Status required**: Regular poison or toxic poison
- **Effect**: Complete ability suppression
- **Duration**: Lasts as long as target remains poisoned

### Ability Suppression Effects
**What gets suppressed:**
- All passive ability effects
- Ability-triggered moves and effects
- Defensive abilities (Sturdy, Multiscale, etc.)
- Offensive abilities (Sheer Force, Tough Claws, etc.)
- Weather/terrain abilities (Drought, Grassy Surge, etc.)
- Entry abilities (Intimidate, Download, etc.)

**What doesn't get suppressed:**
- Form-changing abilities already activated
- Abilities that prevent poison (not applicable here)
- The ability returns immediately when poison is cured

### Poison Status Interaction
**Affected by:**
- Regular poison (1/8 HP damage per turn)
- Toxic poison (incremental damage)
- Poison inflicted by any source
- Both primary and secondary poison status

**Synergies:**
- Toxic Spikes: Pre-set poison trap
- Poison-inducing moves: Toxic, Poison Jab, Sludge Bomb
- Poison Touch: Contact poison chance
- Poison Point: Defensive poison chance

### Strategic Applications
- **Ability shutdown**: Neutralizes powerful abilities
- **Setup prevention**: Stops abilities like Speed Boost
- **Weather control**: Disables weather-setting abilities
- **Defensive neutralization**: Bypasses Sturdy, Multiscale
- **Offensive reduction**: Removes damage-boosting abilities

### Target Interactions
**Excellent against:**
- Weather setters (Drought, Drizzle, Sand Stream)
- Setup abilities (Speed Boost, Moody, Beast Boost)
- Defensive walls (Regenerator, Natural Cure, Magic Guard)
- Offensive threats (Huge Power, Sheer Force, Adaptability)

**Less effective against:**
- Poison-immune types (Steel, Poison)
- Pokémon with Immunity ability (until poisoned)
- Magic Bounce users (reflects poison attempts)
- Substitute users (blocks poison application)

### Poison Application Methods
**Direct moves:**
- Toxic: 100% poison, badly poisoned
- Poison Gas: 90% accuracy, hits all
- Toxic Thread: Poison + Speed drop
- Poison Jab: 30% chance physical move

**Indirect methods:**
- Toxic Spikes: Entry hazard poison
- Poison Touch: 30% on contact
- Poison Point: 30% when hit by contact
- Effect Spore: 10% poison chance

### Competitive Advantages
- **Meta disruption**: Counters ability-reliant strategies
- **Type coverage**: Affects all types once poisoned
- **Persistent effect**: Continuous suppression
- **No activation cost**: Passive ability
- **Stacking pressure**: Combines poison damage + ability loss

### Team Synergies
**Poison support:**
- Toxic Spikes users: Guaranteed poison on switch
- Poison Touch users: Spread poison via contact
- Prankster + Toxic: Priority poison application
- Poison-type attacks: Multiple poison chances

**Battle control:**
- Trappers: Prevent switching to cure poison
- Hazard setters: Stack damage with poison
- Status spreaders: Multiple condition pressure
- Substitute users: Protect while enemy is weakened

### Counters and Limitations
**Direct counters:**
- Steel-types: Poison immunity
- Poison-types: Poison immunity
- Aromatherapy/Heal Bell: Team poison cure
- Refresh: Self-cure move
- Natural Cure: Cures on switch

**Workarounds:**
- Pecha Berry: Instant poison cure
- Lum Berry: Full status cure
- Switching out: Removes poison pressure
- Safeguard: Prevents poison application
- Misty Terrain: Grounded Pokémon poison immunity

### Ability Suppression Details
**Timing:**
- Instant suppression when poisoned
- Immediate restoration when cured
- No lingering effects after cure
- Continuous check each turn

**Special cases:**
- Doesn't prevent ability activation before poison
- Can't suppress abilities that prevent poison initially
- Affects all abilities equally (no immunities)
- Works through Substitute if target is poisoned

### Double Battle Applications
- **Multiple targets**: Can suppress multiple poisoned foes
- **Team support**: Partners can spread poison
- **Ability control**: Neutralize dangerous abilities
- **Strategic targeting**: Choose which abilities to suppress

### Unique Interactions
**With other status:**
- Only poison triggers suppression
- Other status conditions don't activate effect
- Can stack with burn, paralysis, etc.
- Poison must be primary condition

**Priority interactions:**
- Suppression checks constantly
- Updates immediately on poison/cure
- No delay in effect application
- Real-time ability monitoring

### Historical Context
- Elite Redux exclusive ability
- Designed for poison-based strategies
- Counters ability-dependent meta
- Unique poison-ability interaction

### Usage Tips
1. **Poison first**: Ensure reliable poison application
2. **Trap if possible**: Prevent cure via switching
3. **Stack hazards**: Combine with other damage
4. **Protect user**: Keep Hemotoxin user healthy
5. **Team coordination**: Build around poison synergy
