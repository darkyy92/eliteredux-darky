# Discipline - Ability ID 387

## In-Game Description
"Can switch while rampaging. Can't be confused or intimidated."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Prevents confusion and grants immunity to intimidation effects like Taunt. When using rampage moves like Thrash or Outrage, allows switching out during the lock period instead of being forced to continue. After 3 turns, the lock naturally expires without confusion.

*Character count: 284*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Discipline provides a unique combination of status immunity and rampage move flexibility through three distinct mechanisms:

### 1. Confusion Immunity
**Implementation** (`src/abilities.cc` lines 4002-4005):
```cpp
constexpr Ability Discipline = {
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_CONFUSION)
        return TRUE;
    },
```

- Grants complete immunity to confusion from all sources
- Works against Confuse Ray, Swagger confusion, Outrage/Thrash confusion
- Uses the same `CHECK_CONFUSION` flag as other confusion-immune abilities
- Displays ability pop-up when confusion is blocked

### 2. Taunt Immunity
**Implementation** (`src/abilities.cc` line 4008):
```cpp
    .tauntImmune = TRUE,
```

- Complete immunity to Taunt and similar "intimidation" effects
- Allows use of status moves even when Taunt is active
- Shared with abilities like Oblivious, Aroma Veil, and Queenly Majesty
- Prevents mental manipulation and maintains tactical flexibility

### 3. Rampage Switching Mechanism
**Switch Permission** (`src/battle_script_commands.c` lines 4402-4405):
```c
if (BATTLER_HAS_ABILITY(gBattlerAttacker, ABILITY_DISCIPLINE) && gBattleMoves[gChosenMove].effect == EFFECT_RAMPAGE)
    gVolatileStructs[gBattlerAttacker].disciplineCounter = 3;
```

**Lock Timer Management** (`src/battle_util.c` lines 2797-2803):
```c
if (BATTLER_HAS_ABILITY(gActiveBattler, ABILITY_DISCIPLINE) && 
    gVolatileStructs[gActiveBattler].disciplineCounter) {
    gVolatileStructs[gActiveBattler].disciplineCounter--;
    if (gVolatileStructs[gActiveBattler].disciplineCounter == 0) {
        gBattleStruct->choicedMove[gActiveBattler] = MOVE_NONE;
        BattleScriptExecute(BattleScript_DisciplineLockEnds);
    }
}
```

### Rampage Move Interactions

**Affected Moves** (all have `EFFECT_RAMPAGE`):
- **Thrash** (Normal-type, 130 BP, Physical)
- **Petal Dance** (Grass-type, 130 BP, Special) 
- **Outrage** (Dragon-type, 130 BP, Physical)
- **Uproar** (Normal-type, 100 BP, Special)

**Normal Rampage Behavior**:
1. Move locks user for 2-3 turns
2. User cannot switch or use other moves
3. After completion, user becomes confused
4. Lock can only end through fainting or rampage completion

**With Discipline**:
1. User can switch out during the rampage lock
2. 3-turn timer (`disciplineCounter`) tracks the lock duration
3. Timer decrements each turn the user remains in battle
4. When timer reaches 0, lock ends cleanly without confusion
5. Message displays: "{Pokémon} is no longer locked into only using one move!"

### Technical Implementation Details

**Ability Properties**:
- `breakable = TRUE`: Can be suppressed by abilities like Mold Breaker
- `removesStatusOnImmunity = TRUE`: Clears existing confusion when ability activates
- `tauntImmune = TRUE`: Prevents Taunt and similar effects

**Battle Script Integration**:
- Uses `STRINGID_DISCIPLINE_LOCK_ENDS` (ID 684) for lock expiration message
- Integrated with Choice item logic for move locking mechanics
- Compatible with Gorilla Tactics and Sage Power lock systems

### Strategic Implications

**Rampage Move Advantages**:
- Safe usage of high-power rampage moves without confusion risk
- Ability to scout and pivot during rampage sequences
- Maintains team momentum through strategic switching
- Eliminates the traditional drawback of rampage moves

**Status Control Benefits**:
- Complete immunity to confusion disruption
- Taunt immunity enables reliable status/setup moves
- Prevents common confusion + paralysis strategies
- Maintains consistency in battle flow

**Competitive Applications**:
- **Physical Sweepers**: Safe Outrage/Thrash usage
- **Pivot Pokemon**: Switch during rampage for tempo control  
- **Setup Pokemon**: Taunt immunity protects setup moves
- **Mixed Attackers**: Access to diverse move types without lock risk

### Example Battle Scenarios

**Scenario 1 - Rampage Switching**:
1. Dragonite with Discipline uses Outrage (turn 1)
2. Player switches Dragonite out (disciplineCounter = 2)
3. Dragonite returns later, can use any move (lock expired)
4. No confusion inflicted when lock ends

**Scenario 2 - Taunt Immunity**:
1. Opponent uses Taunt on Discipline user
2. Discipline user can still use Dragon Dance, Nasty Plot, etc.
3. Maintains setup potential against disruption strategies

**Scenario 3 - Confusion Prevention**:
1. Opponent uses Confuse Ray
2. Discipline blocks confusion with ability pop-up
3. User maintains clear decision-making

### Interactions with Other Mechanics

**Choice Items**: 
- Choice lock and Discipline rampage lock are separate systems
- Can be locked by Choice Band while using Discipline rampage mechanics
- Timer system doesn't interfere with Choice item restrictions

**Multi-Hit Abilities**:
- Parental Bond works normally with rampage moves
- Each hit contributes to the same rampage sequence
- Discipline switching still available between turns

**Status Conditions**:
- Sleep, paralysis, burn work normally
- Only confusion is blocked by Discipline
- Other mental effects (attraction) may still work

### Competitive Usage Notes

**Tier Placement**: Medium-tier ability providing solid utility
- Valuable on Pokemon that want rampage move access
- Excellent on pivot Pokemon that need flexibility
- Strong on setup sweepers requiring status move access

**Team Synergies**:
- **Momentum Teams**: Enables rampage moves without commitment
- **Setup Offense**: Taunt immunity protects setup sequences
- **Mixed Attackers**: Access to rampage coverage without drawbacks

**Common Users in Elite Redux**:
- Pokemon with access to Outrage/Thrash as coverage
- Setup sweepers that need status move reliability
- Pivot Pokemon that benefit from rampage power + switching

### Counters and Counterplay

**Direct Counters**:
- **Mold Breaker**: Suppresses all Discipline benefits
- **Status Moves**: Sleep, paralysis still work normally
- **Gastro Acid**: Removes ability entirely
- **Raw Power**: Ability provides no defensive stats

**Indirect Counters**:
- **Priority Moves**: Circumvent setup attempts
- **Residual Damage**: Punish switching during rampage
- **Defensive Walls**: Force unfavorable trades
- **Speed Control**: Prevent setup opportunities

### Synergies

**Offensive Synergies**:

**Defensive Synergies**:
- **Multiscale**: Survive to use rampage moves safely
