# Blood Stigma - Ability ID 674

## In-Game Description
Doubles damage against bleeding targets. Immune to all status conditions.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Deal double damage to targets inflicted with bleeding and the user is immune to status effects.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Mechanics

- **Damage Boost**: 2x damage multiplier when target has BLEED status or Blood Stain ability
- **Status Immunity**: Immune to all major status conditions (sleep, poison, burn, freeze, paralysis, toxic, frostbite, bleed)
- **Unsuppressable**: Cannot be disabled by abilities like Neutralizing Gas
- **Status Removal**: Automatically removes status conditions when becoming immune

### Interactions

- **Blood Stain**: Recognizes Pokemon with Blood Stain ability as valid targets for damage boost
- **BLEED Status**: Triggers damage boost against Pokemon with the bleeding status condition
- **Ghost/Rock Types**: Blood Stain ability doesn't affect Ghost or Rock types, so they won't trigger the damage boost
- **Critical Hits**: Works alongside other damage modifiers and critical hit mechanics

### Competitive Usage

Blood Stigma excels in formats where bleeding effects are common. The guaranteed status immunity provides excellent defensive utility, while the conditional 2x damage boost can secure crucial KOs. Pairs well with moves that inflict bleeding or teammates with Blood Stain.
