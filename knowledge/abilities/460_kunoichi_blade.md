# Kunoichi's Blade - Ability ID 460

## In-Game Description
"Technician + Skill Link."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Kunoichi Blade combines Technician and Skill Link effects. Moves with 60 BP or less get a 1.5x power boost, while multi-hit moves like Bullet Seed and Rock Blast always hit the maximum number of times (5 hits). Perfect for multi-hit builds with guaranteed consistency and offensive power.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Kunoichi's Blade is a unique hybrid ability that combines two distinct offensive enhancement effects:
1. **Technician Effect**: Boosts the power of moves with 60 base power or less by 1.5x
2. **Skill Link Effect**: Forces multi-hit moves to always hit the maximum number of times

### Activation Conditions
#### Technician Component
- **Power threshold**: Only affects moves with 60 base power or less
- **Damage calculation**: Applied as a 1.5x multiplier to base power
- **Move examples**: Bullet Seed (25 BP to 37.5 BP per hit), Rock Blast (25 BP to 37.5 BP per hit)
- **Timing**: Applied during damage calculation phase

#### Skill Link Component
- **Multi-hit moves**: Forces moves that hit 2-5 times to always hit 5 times
- **Affected moves**: Bullet Seed, Rock Blast, Icicle Spear, Bone Rush, Pin Missile, etc.
- **Guaranteed consistency**: Eliminates RNG from multi-hit move damage

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability KunoichiBlade = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = Technician.onOffensiveMultiplier,  // 1.5x for ≤60 BP moves
    .skillLink = TRUE,  // Multi-hit moves always hit max times
};

// Technician component
if (basePower <= 60) MUL(1.5);
```

### Synergistic Power
The combination creates powerful synergy:
- Multi-hit moves typically have low base power (≤60 BP)
- Technician boosts each individual hit
- Skill Link guarantees maximum hits
- Result: Consistent high-damage multi-hit attacks

### Move Power Calculations
**Example with Bullet Seed:**
- Base power: 25 BP per hit
- With Technician: 25 x 1.5 = 37.5 BP per hit
- With Skill Link: Always 5 hits guaranteed
- Total effective power: 37.5 x 5 = 187.5 BP
- **Compared to normal Bullet Seed**: 25 x (2-5 random hits) = 50-125 BP average

### Optimal Move Coverage
**Best moves for Kunoichi's Blade:**
- **Bullet Seed** (Grass): 25 BP to 187.5 total effective BP
- **Rock Blast** (Rock): 25 BP to 187.5 total effective BP  
- **Icicle Spear** (Ice): 25 BP to 187.5 total effective BP
- **Pin Missile** (Bug): 25 BP to 187.5 total effective BP
- **Bone Rush** (Ground): 25 BP to 187.5 total effective BP

**Other Technician-boosted moves:**
- Moves ≤60 BP that aren't multi-hit still get 1.5x boost
- Quick Attack, Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, etc.

### Strategic Implications
- **Consistency**: Eliminates multi-hit RNG, providing reliable damage output
- **Type coverage**: Access to multiple types through different multi-hit moves
- **Breaking substitutes**: Multi-hit moves break Substitute and Sturdy
- **Focus Sash counter**: Multiple hits bypass Focus Sash protection
- **Disguise/Ice Face**: Can break disguise effects with guaranteed multi-hits

### Important Interactions
#### Power Boosting Effects
- **STAB**: Applied after Technician boost (37.5 x 1.5 = 56.25 BP per hit)
- **Life Orb**: Stacks with both components for massive damage
- **Choice items**: Provide additional multipliers on top of ability effects
- **Weather boosts**: Sun/Rain boost compatible move types further

#### Defensive Interactions
- **Sturdy/Focus Sash**: Bypassed by guaranteed multi-hits
- **Substitute**: Broken by first hit, remaining hits damage the Pokemon
- **Rocky Helmet/Iron Barbs**: User takes damage for each hit (5x recoil)
- **Contact moves**: Multi-hit contact moves trigger contact effects multiple times

### Common Users and Team Roles
**Ideal Pokemon characteristics:**
- High Attack or Special Attack stats
- Access to multiple multi-hit moves
- Good Speed or bulk to use the ability effectively
- Diverse movepool for type coverage

**Team roles:**
- **Wallbreaker**: Consistent high damage breaks through bulky threats
- **Sweeper setup**: Can break through Focus Sash users reliably
- **Substitute breaker**: Handles Substitute strategies effectively
- **Anti-stall**: Consistent damage output pressures stall teams

### Competitive Advantages
- **Damage reliability**: No RNG in damage output
- **Breaking defensive strategies**: Counters common defensive items/abilities
- **Type flexibility**: Multiple multi-hit moves provide coverage options
- **Setup potential**: Consistent damage makes setup more viable

### Potential Weaknesses
- **Rocky Helmet users**: Take 5x contact damage from multi-hit contact moves
- **Rough Skin/Iron Barbs**: Similar recoil multiplication
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker negates both components
- **Move PP**: Multi-hit moves often have lower PP, requiring PP management

### Synergistic Abilities and Items
**Team support:**
- **Speed control**: Tailwind, Trick Room depending on user's Speed
- **Stat boosts**: Attack/Special Attack boosters enhance damage further
- **Entry hazard support**: Weakens targets for guaranteed KOs

**Held items:**
- **Life Orb**: Massive damage boost with ability effects
- **Choice items**: Lock into powerful multi-hit moves
- **Focus Sash**: Ensures at least one turn of guaranteed multi-hit damage
- **Wide Lens**: Unnecessary due to Skill Link removing miss chance concerns

### Counters and Checks
**Direct counters:**
- **Mold Breaker**: Ignores ability completely
- **Wonder Guard**: Only weak to super-effective hits
- **Magic Guard**: Immune to indirect damage, but not direct damage

**Checks and pressure:**
- **Priority moves**: Bypass Speed issues
- **Status conditions**: Burn halves physical damage
- **Intimidate**: Reduces physical Attack stat
- **Defensive typing**: Resist common multi-hit move types

### Version History
- **Elite Redux exclusive**: Custom ability combining two existing effects
- **Design philosophy**: Rewards skillful move selection and team building
- **Balance considerations**: Powerful but requires specific move investment

### Advanced Applications
- **Choice item synergy**: Lock into a devastating multi-hit move
- **Setup sweeping**: Use after stat boosts for overwhelming power
- **Anti-meta role**: Counters common defensive strategies in competitive play
- **Team building**: Central ability requiring specific move and item support
