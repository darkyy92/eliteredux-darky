# Quark Drive - Ability ID 549

## In-Game Description
"Boosts highest stat in Electric Terrain or with Booster Energy."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Quark Drive boosts the Pokemon's highest stat by 30% (50% for Speed) when Electric Terrain is active or when holding Booster Energy. The boost applies to base stats plus stat stages. Electric Terrain activation is immediate, while Booster Energy is consumed on use for permanent effect.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Quark Drive is a paradox ability that provides stat boosts under specific conditions, making it the Electric-type counterpart to Protosynthesis.

### Core Mechanics
- **Highest Stat Detection**: Uses `GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE)` to determine the highest stat including current stat stages
- **Boost Values**: 
  - Speed: 50% increase (1.5x multiplier)
  - Other stats: 30% increase (1.3x multiplier)
- **Priority**: Electric Terrain > Booster Energy consumption

### Activation Conditions

#### Electric Terrain Activation
```cpp
if (state.source == PARADOX_BOOST_NOT_ACTIVE && IsTerrainActive(STATUS_FIELD_ELECTRIC_TERRAIN)) {
    ParadoxBoost boost = {.source = PARADOX_WEATHER_ACTIVE, .statId = GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE)};
    // Immediate activation when terrain becomes active
}
```

#### Booster Energy Activation
```cpp
if (state.source == PARADOX_BOOST_NOT_ACTIVE && GetBattlerHoldEffect(battler, TRUE) == HOLD_EFFECT_BOOSTER_ENERGY) {
    ParadoxBoost boost = {.source = PARADOX_BOOSTER_ENERGY, .statId = GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE)};
    RemoveItem(battler); // Consumes the item
}
```

### Stat Calculation Process
1. **Base Stat Retrieval**: Gets base stats from `(&gBattleMons[battlerId].attack)[i - 1]`
2. **Stat Stage Application**: Applies current stat stage modifiers using `gStatStageRatios`
3. **Highest Stat Selection**: Compares all stats (ATK, DEF, SPA, SPD, SPE) to find maximum
4. **Boost Application**: Applies 1.5x for Speed or 1.3x for other stats during stat calculations

### Technical Implementation
- **Ability Handler**: `QuarkDriveHandler()` manages state transitions
- **State Management**: Uses `ParadoxBoost` struct to track boost source and target stat
- **Trigger Events**: 
  - `onEntry`: Activates on switch-in if conditions met
  - `onTerrain`: Responds to terrain changes
  - `onStat`: Applies the actual stat multiplier

### Interactions with Other Mechanics

#### Terrain Interactions
- Electric Terrain must be active (not blocked by abilities like Clueless)
- Works with natural Electric Terrain, Electric Surge ability, or moves like Electric Terrain
- Boost ends immediately when Electric Terrain ends (unless Booster Energy activates)

#### Item Interactions
- **Booster Energy Priority**: If Electric Terrain ends while holding Booster Energy, automatically consumes item to maintain boost
- **Permanent Effect**: Booster Energy consumption provides permanent boost until switching out
- **One-Time Use**: Each Booster Energy can only activate the ability once

#### Stat Stage Interactions
- Recalculates highest stat when stat stages change
- Benefits from positive stat stages in highest stat determination
- Ignores stat stage changes if battler doesn't benefit from stat buffs

### Strategic Implications

#### Competitive Usage
- **Electric Terrain Teams**: Synergizes with Electric Surge Pokemon and Electric Terrain setters
- **Booster Energy Sets**: Provides immediate power spike with guaranteed activation
- **Speed Control**: Often boosts Speed stat due to many Quark Drive users having high Speed
- **Wallbreaking**: Significant boost to offensive stats enables breaking through defensive cores

#### Common Users in Elite Redux
Based on the codebase analysis, Quark Drive appears on numerous Future Paradox Pokemon:
- High-speed attackers (often Speed becomes highest stat)
- Balanced statted Pokemon where boost varies by stat stages
- Genderless robotic/mechanical themed Pokemon

### Example Damage Calculations
Assuming a Pokemon with 120 base Attack as highest stat:
- **Without Quark Drive**: 120 base Attack
- **With Quark Drive**: 120 x 1.3 = 156 effective Attack
- **Damage Increase**: ~30% more damage output

For Speed users (130 base Speed):
- **Without Quark Drive**: 130 base Speed  
- **With Quark Drive**: 130 x 1.5 = 195 effective Speed
- **Speed Advantage**: Significant outspeeding potential

### Counters
- **Terrain Control**: Remove Electric Terrain with opposing terrains or weather
- **Ability Suppression**: Gastro Acid, Neutralizing Gas shut down the ability
- **Priority Moves**: Bypass Speed boosts entirely
- **Status Conditions**: Paralysis negates Speed advantages
- **Stat Drops**: Lower the boosted stat to reduce effectiveness

### Synergies
- **Electric Terrain Setters**: Tapu Koko, Pincurchin, Electric Surge users
- **Terrain Extenders**: Terrain Extender item prolongs Electric Terrain
- **Speed Control**: Thunder Wave support to handle faster threats
- **Entry Hazards**: Stealth Rock support for KO ranges with boosted attacks

### Version History
- Introduced in Generation 9 as signature ability of Future Paradox Pokemon
- Elite Redux implementation follows official mechanics with custom stat detection
- Works with Elite Redux's 4-ability system as innate ability on many species
