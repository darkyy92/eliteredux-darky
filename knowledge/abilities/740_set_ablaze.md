# Set Ablaze - Ability ID 740

## In-Game Description
"Inflicting burn also inflicts fear."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Set Ablaze causes the Pokemon to inflict fear status alongside burn whenever it successfully burns an opponent. Fear prevents the target from switching out or using status moves. Works with all burn-inflicting moves and abilities. Creates powerful control combinations.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Set Ablaze is a unique offensive ability that adds fear status to any successful burn infliction. This creates a dual status condition combo that provides both damage over time and battlefield control.

### Activation Conditions
- **Primary trigger**: Whenever the Pokemon successfully inflicts burn on an opponent
- **Sources include**:
  - Burn-inducing moves (Scald, Flamethrower, Will-O-Wisp, etc.)
  - Contact burns from other abilities like Flame Body
  - Secondary burn effects from moves
- **Fear application**: Occurs immediately after burn is confirmed

### Technical Implementation
The ability uses the `setStateOnEffect` mechanism combined with `PoisonPuppeteerClone` pattern:

```c
constexpr Ability SetAblaze = {
    .onReactive = BloodBath.onReactive,  // Uses reactive trigger system
    .onBattlerFaints = PoisonPuppeteer.onBattlerFaints,  // State management
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_OTHER,
    .setStateOnEffect = MOVE_EFFECT_BURN,  // Triggers on burn application
};
```

The ability:
1. Monitors for burn status infliction via `setStateOnEffect = MOVE_EFFECT_BURN`
2. Uses the reactive system to apply fear to targets that don't already have fear
3. Executes via `BattleScript_Bloodlust` which sets `MOVE_EFFECT_FEAR`

### Fear Status Mechanics
Fear is a volatile status that:
- **Prevents switching**: Target cannot switch out normally
- **Blocks status moves**: Target cannot use non-damaging moves
- **Temporary effect**: Fear wears off after several turns or when the fear-inflicting Pokemon switches out
- **No immunity**: Most Pokemon cannot be immune to fear (unlike other statuses)

### Important Interactions
- **Burn immunity**: If target is immune to burn, fear is not applied
- **Already burned**: Fear can still be applied to already burned targets if they lack fear
- **Scald interactions**: Works perfectly with Scald's 30% burn chance
- **Flame Body synergy**: Contact moves can trigger both burn and fear
- **Status overlap**: Burn and fear can coexist with other status conditions

### Strategic Applications

#### Offensive Control
- **Switch trapping**: Forces opponents to stay in unfavorable matchups
- **Status move lockdown**: Prevents setup moves, recovery, and utility moves
- **Momentum control**: Maintains offensive pressure by preventing switches

#### Team Synergy
- **Hazard support**: Pairs well with entry hazards since opponents can't switch
- **Setup opportunities**: Teammates can set up while opponent is fear-locked
- **Wallbreaking**: Breaks defensive cores by preventing switches to counters

### Move Synergies
- **Scald**: Perfect STAB move with reliable burn chance
- **Will-O-Wisp**: Guaranteed burn + fear combo (if hits)
- **Flamethrower/Fire Blast**: Solid burn chances with good damage
- **Sacred Fire**: High burn rate with excellent power
- **Lava Plume**: Spread burn potential in doubles

### Ability Synergies
- **Pyromancy**: Boosts burn chances for more fear opportunities  
- **Serene Grace**: Doubles secondary effect chances including burns
- **Water Compaction**: On Water/Fire types for defensive utility
- **Flash Fire**: Fire immunity while retaining burn capability

### Counters and Limitations
- **Burn immunity**: Fire types, Water Veil, etc. prevent the combo entirely
- **Fear immunity**: Very rare, but some effects can prevent fear
- **Substitute**: Blocks status infliction entirely
- **Magic Bounce**: Reflects Will-O-Wisp back at user
- **Switching moves**: U-turn, Volt Switch, etc. can escape fear

### Competitive Viability
- **Control archetype**: Excellent for control-oriented teams
- **Anti-setup**: Shuts down setup sweepers effectively  
- **Wallbreaker support**: Traps walls for teammates to break
- **Hazard synergy**: Maximizes entry hazard damage
- **Late-game closer**: Powerful endgame control tool

### Common Users
Pokemon that benefit most from Set Ablaze:
- **Fire/Water types**: Natural access to burn moves
- **Bulky attackers**: Can survive to utilize the control aspect
- **Hazard setters**: Maximize trapped opponent punishment
- **Mixed attackers**: Benefit from both physical and special burn moves

### Version History
- **Elite Redux exclusive**: Custom ability not found in mainline games
- **Inspired by**: Control abilities like Shadow Tag and Arena Trap
- **Unique mechanic**: First ability to link two different status effects

### Usage Tips
1. **Priority targets**: Use on setup sweepers and defensive pivots
2. **Timing**: Apply early to maintain control throughout battle
3. **Team building**: Include hazards and setup sweepers as teammates
4. **Coverage**: Ensure burn moves hit different types effectively
5. **Endgame**: Save for crucial late-game control moments
