# Adrenaline Rush - Ability ID 454

## In-Game Description
"KOs raise Speed by one stage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Adrenaline Rush boosts the Pokemon's Speed by one stage whenever it knocks out an opponent. The speed boost applies immediately after the target faints, allowing for enhanced revenge killing potential. Stacks with other speed boosts and works on all KO methods. Ideal for sweepers.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Adrenaline Rush is an offensive momentum ability that provides cumulative Speed boosts for maintaining offensive pressure. Each KO grants a +1 Speed stage boost, allowing for snowball potential.

### Activation Conditions
- **KO requirement**: The Pokemon with Adrenaline Rush must directly cause an opponent to faint
- **Timing**: Speed boost applies immediately after the target faints, before the next Pokemon switches in
- **Boost amount**: +1 Speed stage per KO (maximum +6 stages total)
- **KO methods**: Works on all forms of KO:
  - Direct damage from attacks
  - Indirect damage from status conditions (if the ability user inflicted them)
  - Recoil damage from moves like Take Down
  - Multi-hit moves that cause fainting

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Adrenaline Rush uses MoxieClone function with STAT_SPEED
constexpr Ability AdrenalineRush = {
    .onBattlerFaints = +[](ON_BATTLER_FAINTS) -> int { 
        return MoxieClone(battler, STAT_SPEED); 
    },
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ATTACKER,
};

// MoxieClone function implementation
static int MoxieClone(int battler, int stat) {
    CHECK(HasAttackerFaintedTarget())
    CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, stat, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER | STAT_BUFF_DONT_SET_BUFFERS, NULL))
    BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_RaiseStatOnFaintingTarget);
    return TRUE;
}
```

### Speed Stage Mechanics
- **Stage 1**: 1.5x Speed (50% increase)
- **Stage 2**: 2.0x Speed (100% increase)  
- **Stage 3**: 2.5x Speed (150% increase)
- **Stage 4**: 3.0x Speed (200% increase)
- **Stage 5**: 3.5x Speed (250% increase)
- **Stage 6**: 4.0x Speed (300% increase)

### Important Interactions
- **Multi-hit moves**: Only one Speed boost per target that faints
- **Substitute**: Can activate even if attacking through Substitute
- **Faint prevention**: Doesn't activate if target survives with Focus Sash, Sturdy, etc.
- **Indirect KOs**: Works with status damage if the ability user caused the status
- **Ability suppression**: Cannot activate if ability is suppressed by Mold Breaker effects

### Strategic Applications
- **Revenge killing**: Ideal for fast revenge killers that can outspeed after a KO
- **Late-game sweeping**: Becomes increasingly dangerous as more opponents faint
- **Priority move synergy**: Works well with priority moves for guaranteed first KO
- **Choice item synergy**: Excellent with Choice Scarf or Choice Band for initial KO setup
- **Setup sweeper support**: Allows physical/special sweepers to outspeed after first KO

### Team Building Considerations
- **Fast attackers**: Best on naturally fast Pokemon (90+ base Speed)
- **Strong attackers**: Needs sufficient power to secure KOs reliably  
- **Multi-target moves**: Pokemon with Earthquake, Rock Slide benefit from potential multi-KOs
- **Priority moves**: Bullet Punch, Aqua Jet help guarantee first KO
- **Coverage moves**: Wide movepool helps secure KOs against various types

### Common Users
Adrenaline Rush is typically found on:
- Fast physical attackers with good coverage
- Revenge killers with priority moves
- Late-game cleaners and sweepers
- Pokemon that naturally learn multi-hit or spread moves

### Competitive Usage Patterns
- **Early-game**: Use as revenge killer after team member faints
- **Mid-game**: Look for opportunities to score first KO safely
- **Late-game**: Becomes win condition with multiple speed boosts accumulated
- **Switch timing**: Often best to switch in after a team member faints for revenge

### Synergistic Abilities
When paired with other abilities (in Elite Redux's multi-ability system):
- **Life Orb effect abilities**: Increased damage for more reliable KOs
- **Priority boosting abilities**: Ensures first strike capability
- **Type-changing abilities**: Provides better coverage for securing KOs
- **Stat-boosting abilities**: Compounds the sweeping potential

### Counters and Limitations
- **Sturdy/Focus Sash**: Prevents KO and ability activation
- **Ghost-type switching**: Ghost-types can switch freely from Normal/Fighting moves
- **Defensive walls**: High bulk can prevent KOs needed for activation
- **Status conditions**: Paralysis and burn can limit sweeping potential
- **Priority moves**: Opposing priority can revenge kill despite speed boost
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas shut down the ability

### Comparison to Similar Abilities
- **Moxie**: Boosts Attack instead of Speed (ID varies)
- **Beast Boost**: Boosts highest stat instead of specific stat
- **Grim Neigh**: Boosts Special Attack instead of Speed
- **Chilling Neigh**: Also boosts Attack like Moxie

### Version History
- Introduced in Elite Redux as part of expanded ability roster
- Functions identically to standard Moxie-type abilities but with Speed focus
- Part of the momentum-based ability family for offensive team strategies

### Damage Calculation Impact
While Adrenaline Rush doesn't directly affect damage, the Speed boosts enable:
- **Outspeeding revenge killers**: Prevents common revenge kill attempts
- **Choice Scarf users**: Can eventually outspeed even scarfed opponents
- **Speed tiers**: Moves Pokemon into higher speed tiers for consistent outspeeding
- **Turn order control**: Allows user to maintain offensive pressure and momentum
