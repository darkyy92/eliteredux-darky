# Marine Apex - Ability ID 389

## In-Game Description
"Deals 1.5x damage to Water-types and bypasses screens."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Marine Apex transforms the user into the ultimate aquatic predator, dealing 1.5x damage to Water-type targets while completely bypassing defensive screens (Light Screen, Reflect, Aurora Veil) and Substitutes. Perfect for breaking through bulky Water walls.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Overview
Marine Apex is a powerful offensive ability that combines type-specific damage enhancement with screen-bypassing capabilities. It represents the concept of an apex predator that dominates aquatic environments while possessing the cunning to bypass defensive barriers.

## Technical Implementation

### Source Code Location
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
- **Definition**: Lines 4020-4026
- **Registration**: Line 9233

### Code Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability MarineApex = {
    .onInfiltrate = Infiltrator.onInfiltrate,
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            if (IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE(target, TYPE_WATER)) RESISTANCE(1.5);
        },
};
```

### Infiltrator Reference
```cpp
constexpr Ability Infiltrator = {
    .onInfiltrate = +[](ON_INFILTRATE) -> InfiltrateType { 
        return INFILTRATE_SCREENS | INFILTRATE_SUBSTITUTE; 
    },
};
```

## Mechanics

### Primary Effect: Anti-Water Damage Boost
- **Multiplier**: 1.5x damage against Water-type Pokemon
- **Implementation**: Uses the `RESISTANCE` macro which applies both resistance and damage modifiers
- **Trigger**: When attacking any Pokemon with Water typing (primary or secondary)

### Secondary Effect: Infiltrator Properties
- **Screen Bypass**: Ignores Light Screen, Reflect, and Aurora Veil
- **Substitute Bypass**: Attacks go through Substitute
- **Implementation**: Inherits the complete `onInfiltrate` function from Infiltrator

## Strategic Analysis

### Competitive Viability: Medium Tier
- **Strengths**: 
  - Strong counter to Water-type threats
  - Screen bypass provides utility against defensive teams
  - Combines offensive and utility aspects
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Situational damage boost (only vs Water-types)
  - No defensive benefits
  - Limited impact against non-Water teams

### Optimal Usage Scenarios
1. **Water-Heavy Metagames**: Excels when Water-types are prevalent
2. **Screen Teams**: Provides consistent damage output against defensive setups
3. **Mixed Attackers**: Benefits Pokemon that can capitalize on both physical and special attacks
