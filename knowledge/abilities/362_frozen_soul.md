# Frozen Soul - Ability ID 362

## In-Game Description
"Gives priority to Ice-type moves when at full HP."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Frozen Soul grants +1 priority to all Ice-type moves when the user is at maximum HP. This powerful ability allows Ice-type attackers to strike first with moves like Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Icicle Crash, bypassing speed tiers entirely. The priority boost is lost if any damage is taken.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Overview
Frozen Soul is a priority-granting ability that gives Ice-type moves +1 priority when the user is at maximum HP. It is functionally identical to Gale Wings but for Ice-type moves instead of Flying-type moves, making it a powerful tool for Ice-type attackers who can maintain their health.

## Code Implementation

### Source Location
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
- **Line**: 3796-3798
- **Definition**: `constexpr Ability FrozenSoul = { .onPriority = GALE_WINGS_CLONE(TYPE_ICE), };`

### Macro Definition
The ability uses the `GALE_WINGS_CLONE` macro (lines 128-133):
```cpp
#define GALE_WINGS_CLONE(type)                               \
    +[](ON_PRIORITY) -> int {                                \
        CHECK(GetTypeBeforeUsingMove(move, battler) == type) \
        CHECK(BATTLER_MAX_HP(battler))                       \
        return 1;                                            \
    }
```

### Key Technical Details
- **HP Check**: Uses `BATTLER_MAX_HP(battler)` macro defined in `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/include/battle.h:781`
  - Formula: `(gBattleMons[battlerId].hp == gBattleMons[battlerId].maxHP)`
- **Type Check**: Verifies move type before usage via `GetTypeBeforeUsingMove()`
- **Priority Boost**: Returns `1` for +1 priority boost
- **Ability Registration**: Listed in ability table at line 9207

## Mechanics

### Activation Requirements
1. **Maximum HP**: The Pokemon must have full HP (current HP = max HP)
2. **Ice-type Move**: The move being used must be Ice-type
3. **Move Usage**: Only applies when the Pokemon is using a move

### Priority System
- Normal moves have priority 0
- With Frozen Soul active, Ice moves get priority +1
- This allows Ice moves to outspeed most other moves
- Does not stack with other priority effects

### Limitations
- **HP Dependent**: Any damage taken disables the ability until HP is restored to maximum
- **Type Specific**: Only affects Ice-type moves
- **No Status Moves**: Only affects damaging and non-damaging Ice-type moves

## Strategic Applications

### Offensive Strategies
1. **Lead Sweeping**: Perfect for fast Ice-type leads with powerful moves
2. **Revenge Killing**: Guaranteed first strike when at full HP
3. **Priority Control**: Dominates priority wars with Ice moves
4. **Setup Protection**: Can interrupt setup attempts with priority Ice moves

### Synergistic Moves
- **Ice Beam**: Reliable priority special attack
- **Blizzard**: High-power priority special move (perfect accuracy in hail)
- **Icicle Crash**: Strong priority physical attack
- **Freeze-Dry**: Priority move that hits Water-types super effectively
- **Ice Shard**: Already has priority, becomes +2 priority

### Team Building Considerations
- Pairs well with healing support (Wish, Heal Bell)
- Benefits from Leftovers or other passive recovery
- Strong with Life Orb for maximum damage output
- Excellent with Choice items for hit-and-run tactics
- Synergizes with hail support for Blizzard accuracy

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Immediate Threat**: Forces opponents to respect priority Ice moves
2. **Speed Control**: Bypasses speed tiers entirely when active
3. **Versatile**: Works with both physical and special Ice moves
4. **Psychological Pressure**: Opponents must play around potential priority
5. **Type Coverage**: Ice moves hit many common types super effectively

### Weaknesses
1. **HP Dependency**: Easily disabled by any damage
2. **Type Limitation**: No priority on non-Ice moves
3. **Predictable**: Opponents know to damage first to disable
4. **Stealth Rock Vulnerability**: Ice types are often weak to Rock moves
5. **Limited STAB Users**: Fewer Ice-type Pokemon compared to other types

### Comparison to Similar Abilities
- **Gale Wings**: Same mechanics but for Flying-type moves
- **Flaming Soul**: Same mechanics but for Fire-type moves  
- **Triage**: +3 priority but only for healing moves
- **Prankster**: +1 priority for status moves only
- **Quick Draw**: 30% chance for +1 priority on any move

## Conclusion

Frozen Soul is a high-impact ability that transforms Ice-type Pokemon into immediate threats when at full HP. Its strategic value lies in the constant pressure it applies to opponents, forcing them to prioritize dealing damage to disable the ability. While HP-dependent, skilled players can leverage healing support and careful positioning to maintain the advantage throughout battle.

The ability rewards aggressive play while punishing passive strategies, making it excellent for fast-paced offensive teams that can protect their Frozen Soul user's HP while applying constant pressure with priority Ice moves. The synergy with hail weather and moves like Blizzard makes it particularly potent in weather-based team compositions.

Ice-type moves' natural coverage against Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground types makes Frozen Soul users versatile revenge killers and offensive threats that can break through many common defensive strategies when properly supported.
