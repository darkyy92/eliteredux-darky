# Mummy - Ability ID 152

## In-Game Description
"If hit, makes the attacker's ability Mummy."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Mummy spreads when hit by contact moves, replacing the attacker's ability with Mummy unless they have Ability Shield or an unsuppressable ability. Particularly effective against physical attackers, disrupting their strategies and spreading the curse through battle teams.

*Character count: 297*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Core Mechanics:**
- When the Mummy user is hit by a **contact move**, the attacker's ability is immediately replaced with Mummy
- The effect activates after damage calculation but before any other contact-based abilities
- Creates a "viral" spreading effect where multiple Pokemon can end up with Mummy

**Activation Conditions:**
1. **Move must hit**: Uses `ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(attacker)` which checks `DidMoveHit() && IsBattlerAlive(applyTo)`
2. **Contact required**: Uses `IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker)` - only physical contact moves trigger the effect
3. **Attacker doesn't have Mummy**: Prevents redundant activation with `HasAbilityIgnoringSuppression(attacker, ability)`
4. **Ability can be changed**: Blocks activation against persistent/unsuppressable abilities via `IsPersistentOrUnsuppressableAbility(GetBattlerAbility(attacker))`
5. **No Ability Shield**: The Ability Shield held item blocks Mummy with `DoesBattlerHaveAbilityShield(attacker)`

**Technical Implementation:**
```cpp
constexpr Ability Mummy = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(attacker))
        CHECK_NOT(HasAbilityIgnoringSuppression(attacker, ability))
        CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(move, attacker))
        CHECK_NOT(IsPersistentOrUnsuppressableAbility(GetBattlerAbility(attacker)))
        CHECK_NOT(DoesBattlerHaveAbilityShield(attacker))

        UpdateAbilityStateIndicesForNewAbility(attacker, ability);
        ReplaceAbility(attacker, ability);
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_MummyActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

**Abilities That Block Mummy:**
- **Persistent abilities**: Cannot be changed once set (like Multitype on Arceus)
- **Unsuppressable abilities**: Core form-dependent abilities that cannot be removed
- **Any ability protected by Ability Shield**: The held item provides complete protection

**Contact Moves That Trigger Mummy:**
- All physical moves that make contact (Tackle, Punch moves, Body Slam, etc.)
- Some special moves with contact flags (Grass Knot, Petal Dance in some implementations)
- **Does NOT trigger on**: Earthquake, Rock Slide, Flamethrower, Psychic, etc. (non-contact moves)

**Strategic Applications:**
1. **Disruption Tool**: Removes key abilities from physical attackers (Huge Power, Guts, Speed Boost, etc.)
2. **Team Spread**: Multiple opposing Pokemon can end up with Mummy through chain reactions
3. **Anti-Physical Tank**: Punishes contact-based physical attackers heavily
4. **Doubles Strategy**: Can disrupt both opponents' abilities if they both use contact moves

**Interactions with Other Mechanics:**
- **Trace**: Pokemon with Trace will copy Mummy, but won't spread it until hit by contact
- **Role Play/Skill Swap**: Can be copied/swapped normally since it's not unsuppressable
- **Neutralizing Gas**: Temporarily suppresses Mummy like other abilities
- **Multi-hit moves**: Mummy activates on the first hit that makes contact

**Common Users in Elite Redux:**
- **Dusclops**: Bulky physical wall with Mummy as disruption option
- **Yamask**: Early-game Mummy spreader with decent defensive stats
- **Cofagrigus**: Evolved form with improved bulk and Ghost/Steel typing for better survivability

**Damage Calculations:**
- Mummy activates AFTER damage is calculated, so the original ability affects the damage dealt
- Example: Huge Power Machamp hits Dusclops → Machamp deals doubled damage → Machamp loses Huge Power and gains Mummy

**Battle Message:**
- Displays "ATTACKER acquired MUMMY!" when the ability is successfully transferred
- Uses `BattleScript_MummyActivates` which calls `STRINGID_ATTACKERACQUIREDABILITY`

**Competitive Viability:**
- Strong anti-meta tool against physical sweepers
- Particularly effective in formats with common contact moves
- Can single-handedly shut down setup sweepers that rely on abilities
- Weak to special attackers and non-contact physical moves
