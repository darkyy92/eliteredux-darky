# Analytic - Ability ID 148

## In-Game Description
"Attacks get a 1.3x power boost if it moves last."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Analytic boosts attack power by 30% when the user moves after the target. The boost applies to all damaging moves except Future Sight and Doom Desire. Works when the target has already acted this turn, making it excellent for slow attackers who naturally move last in battle.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Power Boost**: 1.3x damage multiplier (30% increase)
- **Activation Condition**: When `GetBattlerTurnOrderNum(target) < gCurrentTurnActionNumber`
- **Move Restriction**: Does not affect Future Sight or Doom Desire (`gBattleMoves[move].effect != EFFECT_FUTURE_SIGHT`)

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Analytic = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            if (GetBattlerTurnOrderNum(target) < gCurrentTurnActionNumber && gBattleMoves[move].effect != EFFECT_FUTURE_SIGHT) MUL(1.3);
        },
};
```

### Turn Order Mechanics
The ability determines activation by comparing:
1. **Target's Turn Position**: `GetBattlerTurnOrderNum(target)` - when the target is scheduled to move
2. **Current Action Number**: `gCurrentTurnActionNumber` - how many Pokemon have already acted

If the target has already moved (target's position < current action), Analytic activates.

### Future Sight Exception
Future Sight and Doom Desire are specifically excluded because:
- They strike 3 turns in the future, not during the current turn
- The original user might not even be on the field when they hit
- Turn order context doesn't apply to delayed attacks

### Activation Examples

**Scenario 1: Speed-based turns**
- Turn order: Fast Pokemon (1) to Slow Pokemon with Analytic (2)
- Fast Pokemon attacks first
- Slow Pokemon's Analytic activates (1 < 2) ✓

**Scenario 2: Priority moves**
- Turn order: Priority user (1) to Analytic user (2)
- Priority move goes first
- Analytic activates on response (1 < 2) ✓

**Scenario 3: Same priority, different speeds**
- Fast attacker moves before slow Analytic user
- Analytic activates ✓

### Strategic Implications

#### Optimal Users
Analytic excels on:
- **Slow, powerful attackers** - Naturally move last to trigger boost
- **Trick Room sweepers** - Turn order reversal guarantees activation
- **Choice Band/Specs users** - Stacks with damage-boosting items
- **Wall breakers** - 30% boost helps break through defenses

#### Team Synergy
- **Trick Room**: Reverses speed tiers, making slow Analytic users move first (ironically reducing effectiveness in TR)
- **Speed control**: Using moves like Icy Wind to ensure moving last
- **Pivoting**: Slow U-turn/Volt Switch users can revenge kill with boosted attacks

### Move Interactions

#### Boosted Moves
- All physical and special attacks (except Future Sight/Doom Desire)
- Multi-hit moves get the boost on each hit
- Variable power moves (e.g., Gyro Ball, Payback)
- Status moves that deal damage (e.g., Thunder Wave variants)

#### Unboosted Moves
- Future Sight and Doom Desire specifically
- Pure status moves (don't deal damage)
- Self-targeting moves

### Damage Calculations

**Example**: Analytic Machamp using Close Combat
- Base Attack: 300 (after stat boosts)
- Close Combat Base Power: 120
- Analytic Boost: 1.3x
- **Total**: 300 x 120 x 1.3 = 46,800 damage calculation base

Compare to no boost: 300 x 120 = 36,000
**Effective increase**: 30% more damage

### Interactions with Other Abilities

#### Synergistic Combinations
**Strategic Pause (Analytic + Crit boost)**:
- 30% damage boost when moving last
- +2 critical hit ratio when moving last
- Devastating combination for slow sweepers

**Haste Makes Waste (Analytic + Stall)**:
- 30% damage boost when moving last  
- 30% damage reduction when being attacked first
- Perfect for slow bulky attackers

**Calculative (Analytic + Neuroforce)**:
- 30% boost when moving last
- Additional boost on super-effective moves
- Creates extremely powerful coverage attackers

#### Counters and Limitations
- **Speed control**: Paralysis, Tailwind can disrupt activation
- **Priority abuse**: Prankster, Gale Wings bypass turn order
- **Fast pivoting**: Quick U-turn/Volt Switch before Analytic user acts
- **Trick Room**: Can backfire by making Analytic user move first

### Common Users in Elite Redux

Based on the species data, Analytic appears on:
- **Porygon line** (Porygon-Z): Special attackers with diverse movepool
- **Slowking variants**: Bulky special attackers
- **Steel types**: Defensive pivots with powerful attacks  
- **Various moths/bugs**: Often paired with other analytical abilities
- **Psychic types**: Mixed attackers benefiting from turn prediction

### Competitive Analysis

#### Strengths
- Consistent 30% damage boost for slow Pokemon
- No setup required - passive benefit
- Stacks with all other damage modifiers
- Excellent for revenge killing faster threats

#### Weaknesses  
- Completely dependent on turn order
- No benefit when moving first
- Future Sight immunity reduces some niche strategies
- Can be manipulated by priority moves

#### Usage Tips
1. **EV Spreads**: Minimize Speed investment to ensure moving last
2. **Item Choices**: Life Orb, Choice items stack multiplicatively  
3. **Move Selection**: Powerful STAB moves benefit most from the boost
4. **Prediction**: Works best when you can predict opponent's actions
5. **Team Support**: Pair with entry hazards to secure KOs with boosted attacks

## Conclusion

Analytic transforms slow Pokemon from potential liabilities into powerful revenge killers and wall breakers. The 30% damage boost is substantial enough to change many damage calculations, turning 2HKOs into OHKOs. While situational, it rewards patient play and good prediction skills. In Elite Redux's multi-ability system, Analytic combines excellently with other tactical abilities to create unique strategic profiles that balance offense and defense around turn order manipulation.
