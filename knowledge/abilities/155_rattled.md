# Rattled - Ability ID 155

## In-Game Description
"If hit by Bug, Dark or Ghost move, or flinches: +1 Speed."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Rattled boosts Speed by one stage when hit by Bug, Dark, or Ghost-type moves. The boost applies after damage calculation but before the move ends. Only works on damaging moves and doesn't activate if the Pokemon faints from the hit. Provides defensive utility by turning weaknesses into opportunity.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Rattled is a defensive ability that boosts the user's Speed stat by one stage (+50% Speed) when triggered by specific conditions.

### Current Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Rattled = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(moveType == TYPE_DARK || moveType == TYPE_BUG || moveType == TYPE_GHOST)
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_SPEED))

        SetStatChanger(STAT_SPEED, 1);
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_TargetAbilityStatRaiseOnMoveEnd);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Activation Conditions
**Currently Implemented:**
- Hit by a Bug-type move that deals damage
- Hit by a Dark-type move that deals damage  
- Hit by a Ghost-type move that deals damage

**Listed in Description but Not Implemented:**
- When the Pokemon flinches (mentioned in proto description but no code implementation found)

### Technical Requirements
- `ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler)` must return true
- Move must be Bug, Dark, or Ghost type
- `CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_SPEED)` must return true (Speed not at +6)
- Pokemon must survive the hit to gain the boost

### Stat Boost Details
- **Boost Amount**: +1 Speed stage (50% increase)
- **Maximum**: Won't trigger if Speed is already at +6 stages
- **Timing**: Activates after damage calculation, before move end
- **Battle Script**: Uses `BattleScript_TargetAbilityStatRaiseOnMoveEnd`

### Interaction Notes
- **Multi-Hit Moves**: Each hit can potentially trigger Rattled separately
- **Status Moves**: Do not trigger Rattled (damage-dealing moves only)
- **Substitute**: Blocked by Substitute (no damage = no trigger)
- **Magic Guard**: Still triggers even if Magic Guard prevents damage
- **Fainting**: Does not activate if the Pokemon faints from the triggering move

### Strategic Applications
**Defensive Utility:**
- Turns common attacking types (Dark, Ghost, Bug) into Speed boosts
- Particularly valuable on bulky Pokemon that can survive super-effective hits
- Synergizes with survival items like Focus Sash or Leftovers

**Speed Control:**
- Can potentially outspeed threats after taking a hit
- Useful for revenge killing or setting up on the following turn
- Combines well with priority moves for immediate retaliation

### Notable Users in Elite Redux
Based on the species data, Rattled appears on various Pokemon including:
- **Dratini line**: As a regular ability option
- **Pawmi line**: Speed-oriented Electric types
- **Fennekin line**: Fire starters with good Special Attack
- **Dugtrio**: Already fast Ground types
- **Tinkaton line**: Defensive Steel types
- Various other species as innate or regular abilities

### Competitive Considerations
**Strengths:**
- Provides immediate Speed control after taking super-effective damage
- Cannot be suppressed by Mold Breaker (ability activates post-hit)
- Useful on both offensive and defensive team roles

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires taking damage to activate (risky on frail Pokemon)  
- Limited to three specific types
- Flinch trigger apparently not implemented despite being in description
- One-time boost per battle scenario (unless Speed is lowered)

### Counters and Limitations
- **Taunt**: Prevents setup moves that might follow the Speed boost
- **Status Moves**: Paralysis or sleep negate the Speed advantage
- **Priority Moves**: Bypass the Speed boost entirely
- **Non-Triggering Types**: Many common attacking types don't activate it

### Synergistic Abilities and Items
**Items:**
- **Focus Sash**: Guarantees survival to gain the Speed boost
- **Weakness Policy**: Stacks with Rattled for both offensive and Speed boosts
- **Life Orb**: Capitalizes on the Speed boost with powered-up attacks

**Ability Combinations** (in Elite Redux's 4-ability system):
- **Quick Feet**: Double Speed boost when statused
- **Guts**: Attack boost to complement the Speed boost
- **Magic Guard**: Protects from residual damage while boosting

### Version History and Implementation Notes
- The description mentions flinch triggering Rattled, but current code implementation only handles the three move types
- This suggests either incomplete implementation or outdated description text
- AI evaluation rates this ability at 3/10 for competitive value

### Example Damage Calculations
On a Pokemon with base 100 Speed and no investment:
- **Before trigger**: 299 Speed (level 50, neutral nature)
- **After Rattled (+1)**: 448 Speed (50% increase)
- **After Rattled + Choice Scarf**: 672 Speed
- **After Rattled + Tailwind**: 896 Speed (quadruple boost scenario)
