# Parental Bond - Ability ID 185

## In-Game Description
"Moves hit twice. 1st hit at 100% power, 2nd hit at 25%."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Most moves hit twice: first strike at full power, second at 25%. Multi-hit moves, status moves, and certain special moves only hit once. Damage calculation and effects apply separately for each hit, making this excellent for breaking Focus Sashes and Substitutes while triggering abilities twice.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

**Basic Information:**
- **Name**: Parental Bond
- **ID**: 185
- **Generation**: VI (X/Y)
- **Type**: Offensive Multi-hit

### Core Functionality
Parental Bond causes most moves to hit twice with the following power distribution:
- **First hit**: 100% power (full damage)
- **Second hit**: 25% power (quarter damage)

### Implementation Details
- Uses `PARENTAL_BOND_HYPER_AGGRESSIVE` type
- Power multiplier for second hit: `UQ_4_12(0.25)` (25%)
- Resistant to Fort Knox (ability cannot be suppressed by certain effects)

### Move Interactions
- **Works with**: Single-target damaging moves, most special moves
- **Doesn't work with**: Multi-hit moves (Bullet Seed, Rock Blast, etc.), status moves, moves that already hit multiple times
- **Each hit**: Calculated separately for damage, type effectiveness, and critical hits

### Strategic Advantages
1. **Focus Sash Breaking**: Second hit breaks Focus Sash after first hit survival
2. **Substitute Breaking**: Guaranteed to break Substitute unless it has very high HP
3. **Ability Triggers**: Each hit can trigger contact-based abilities (Static, Flame Body, etc.)
4. **Status Chances**: Each hit rolls for additional effects independently

### Battle Calculations
- Total damage about 125% of original move power (100% + 25%)
- Each hit calculated with full stats, type effectiveness, and modifiers
- Critical hits determined separately for each strike
