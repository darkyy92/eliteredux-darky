# Big Leaves (Ability #374)

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 374
- **Name**: Big Leaves
- **Type**: Multi-Ability Fusion
- **Description**: "Chloroplast + Chlorophyll + Leaf Guard + Harvest + Solar Power."

## Extended In-Game Description
A powerhouse fusion of five grass-type abilities. Combines Harvest's berry restoration, Leaf Guard's sun healing, Solar Power's special attack boost, Chlorophyll's speed boost, and grants Weather Ball double power while nullifying Solar Beam's power reduction in bad weather.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
Big Leaves is implemented as a combination of five separate abilities:

#### 1. Harvest Component
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 1596-1606)
- **Function**: Restores consumed berries at the end of turn
- **Mechanics**: 
  - 100% chance in sun, 50% chance otherwise
  - Only works if the Pokémon has no held item
  - Only restores berries (pocket check: `POCKET_BERRIES`)

#### 2. Leaf Guard Component
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 1252-1259)
- **Function**: Heals status conditions in sun
- **Mechanics**: Cures all status ailments when sun is active

#### 3. Solar Power Component
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 1194-1200)
- **Function**: Boosts special attack in sun
- **Mechanics**: 1.5x multiplier to highest attacking stat in sun

#### 4. Chlorophyll Component
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 663-668)
- **Function**: Boosts speed in sun
- **Mechanics**: 1.5x speed multiplier in sun

#### 5. Chloroplast Property
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (line 3892)
- **Function**: Special property that affects Weather Ball and Solar Beam
- **Mechanics**:
  - Weather Ball gets 2x power boost (line 6607 in `battle_util.c`)
  - Solar Beam ignores power reduction in bad weather (lines 6920-6921 in `battle_util.c`)

### Implementation Details

```cpp
constexpr Ability BigLeaves = {
    .onEndTurn = +[](ON_END_TURN) -> int { 
        return Harvest.onEndTurn(DELEGATE_END_TURN) | LeafGuard.onEndTurn(DELEGATE_END_TURN); 
    },
    .onStat = +[](ON_STAT) {
        SolarPower.onStat(DELEGATE_STAT);
        Chlorophyll.onStat(DELEGATE_STAT);
    },
    .chloroplast = TRUE,
};
```

**Location**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc` (lines 3885-3893)

### Weather Ball Enhancement
- **Function**: `battle_util.c` line 6607
- **Effect**: Weather Ball receives 2x power when used by Pokémon with chloroplast property
- **Priority**: Applied before weather-based Weather Ball effects

### Solar Beam Protection
- **Function**: `battle_util.c` lines 6920-6921
- **Effect**: Solar Beam maintains full power in hail, sandstorm, rain, and fog
- **Mechanics**: Bypasses the 0.5x power reduction normally applied in adverse weather

## Strategic Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Sun Synergy**: All effects work optimally in sunny weather
2. **Multi-layered Benefits**: Five different advantages from a single ability slot
3. **Offensive Power**: 1.5x special attack boost in sun
4. **Speed Control**: 1.5x speed boost in sun for sweeping potential
5. **Sustainability**: Berry restoration and status healing
6. **Move Enhancement**: Weather Ball becomes a 100 base power move, Solar Beam ignores weather penalties

### Weaknesses
1. **Weather Dependency**: Most benefits require sun to activate
2. **Sun Vulnerability**: No protection against Fire-type attacks (unlike Solar Power alone)
3. **Berry Limitation**: Harvest only affects berries, not other consumables
4. **Competitive Weather**: Struggles when opposing weather abilities are present

### Optimal Conditions
- **Best Weather**: Harsh Sunlight (activates all benefits)
- **Recommended Moves**: Solar Beam, Weather Ball, any special attacks
- **Synergy Items**: Berries (Harvest compatibility), Heat Rock (sun extension)
- **Team Support**: Drought setters, sun team members

## Competitive Applications

### Set Recommendations
1. **Sun Sweeper**: Focus on high special attack moves with speed investment
2. **Weather Ball Abuser**: Capitalize on doubled Weather Ball power
3. **Solar Beam Tank**: Use Solar Beam's immunity to weather reduction
4. **Berry Cycling**: Utilize Harvest for repeated berry activation

### Damage Calculations
- **Weather Ball**: 50 base power → 100 base power (2x from chloroplast) → 150 base power in sun
- **Solar Beam**: 120 base power maintained in all weather conditions
- **Special Attacks**: 1.5x damage boost in sun from Solar Power component

### Counters and Checks
- **Weather Control**: Rain Dance, Sandstorm setters to remove sun
- **Priority Moves**: Bypass speed boost advantage
- **Physical Attackers**: Solar Power only boosts special attack
- **Fire Types**: Can threaten with sun-boosted attacks
