# On the Prowl - Ability ID 648

## In-Game Description
+1 priority for the first turn. Negative priority becomes +0.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

All moves with priority 0 or higher gain +1 priority on the user's first turn. Negative priority moves become priority 0 instead of adding +1 priority.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

On the Prowl enhances battle initiative upon entry. During the first turn after switching in, all moves with priority 0 or higher gain +1 priority, making them faster than usual. Negative priority moves become priority 0, eliminating their speed penalty and allowing normal-speed execution instead.
