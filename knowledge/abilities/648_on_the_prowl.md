# On the Prowl

**Game Description:** "+1 priority for the first turn. Negative priority becomes +0."

**Extended Description:** On the Prowl enhances battle initiative upon entry. During the first turn after switching in, all moves with priority 0 or higher gain +1 priority, making them faster than usual. Negative priority moves become priority 0, eliminating their speed penalty and allowing normal-speed execution instead.
