# Piercing Solo - Ability ID 639

## In-Game Description
Sound moves cause bleeding.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When landing a sound move, the user inflicts bleeding. Bleeding causes 1/16 max HP damage per turn, prevents healing, and negates the effects of stat stages. Rock and Ghost types are immune to bleeding.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Mechanics

- Activates when the user successfully hits with any sound-based move
- Applies the bleed status condition to the target
- Only affects targets that are capable of bleeding (not Steel-types, etc.)
- Works with all sound moves: Hyper Voice, Screech, Sing, Roar, and others
- The bleeding effect deals damage over multiple turns after being applied

### Strategic Use

This ability excels at turning support-oriented sound moves into offensive tools. Moves like Sing or Screech become dual-purpose, providing their normal effects while also inflicting residual damage. Pairs well with Pokemon that learn multiple sound moves or have ways to boost their sound move damage.
