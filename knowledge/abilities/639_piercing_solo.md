# Piercing Solo

**ID:** 639  
**Description:** Sound moves cause bleeding.

## Extended In-Game Description
Piercing Solo turns the user into a sound-based predator. When any sound move hits an opponent, the intense vibrations pierce through defenses and cause internal bleeding. This transforms utility sound moves into damaging threats over time, making Pokemon with this ability dangerous.

## Mechanics

- Activates when the user successfully hits with any sound-based move
- Applies the bleed status condition to the target
- Only affects targets that are capable of bleeding (not Steel-types, etc.)
- Works with all sound moves: Hyper Voice, Screech, Sing, Roar, and others
- The bleeding effect deals damage over multiple turns after being applied

## Strategic Use

This ability excels at turning support-oriented sound moves into offensive tools. Moves like Sing or Screech become dual-purpose, providing their normal effects while also inflicting residual damage. Pairs well with Pokemon that learn multiple sound moves or have ways to boost their sound move damage.
