# Master Hand - Ability ID 683

## In-Game Description
Mega Launcher + Rampage effects.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Master Hand merges Mega Launcher and Rampage abilities. Aura and pulse moves gain 30% power while status moves become enhanced. After defeating opponents, recharge status immediately ends, enabling continuous offensive chains through boosted projectile attacks and relentless momentum.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Effects

#### Mega Launcher Component
- Boosts the power of aura and pulse moves by 30%
- Affects moves with the Mega Launcher boost flag
- Also enhances all status moves when used by the wielder

#### Rampage Component  
- When this Pokemon causes an opponent to faint, it immediately loses any Recharge status
- Removes the need to recharge after using moves like Hyper Beam or Giga Impact
- Allows for continuous offensive pressure after securing knockouts

### Synergy
The combination creates a formidable sweeping ability where pulse-based attacks deal increased damage, and successful KOs enable immediate follow-up attacks without recharge downtime.
