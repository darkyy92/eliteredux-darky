# Download - Ability ID 88

## In-Game Description
"Raises Atk/Sp. Atk by one stage depending on opponent."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Download analyzes the opposing Pokémon's defenses upon entering battle. If the foe's Defense is higher than Special Defense, it raises Special Attack by one stage. If Special Defense is higher or equal, it raises Attack by one stage. Works on switch-in and analyzes actual stat values including boosts.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**DOWNLOAD** is an entry ability that provides an adaptive offensive boost based on the opponent's defensive stats.

### Activation Mechanics:
- **Trigger**: On entry to battle (onEntry hook)
- **Target Analysis**: Examines the opposing Pokémon's Defense vs Special Defense
- **Stat Comparison**: Uses actual stat values including stat stage modifiers
- **Boost Applied**: +1 stage to either Attack or Special Attack

### Stat Comparison Logic:
1. **Target Selection**:
   - Primary: Direct opponent across from the user
   - Fallback: If primary target is fainted, checks partner's opponent
   - Fails if no valid target exists

2. **Defense Calculation**:
   - Compares Defense vs Special Defense including stat stages
   - Uses `GetHighestDefendingStatId` function with stat stages included
   - If Defense > Special Defense → Raises Special Attack
   - If Special Defense ≥ Defense → Raises Attack

3. **Boost Application**:
   - Standard +1 stat stage increase
   - Subject to normal stat stage limits (+6 maximum)
   - Triggers ability notification animation

### Technical Implementation:
```c
constexpr Ability Download = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        gBattlerTarget = BATTLE_OPPOSITE(battler);
        if (!IsBattlerAlive(battler)) gBattlerTarget = BATTLE_PARTNER(gBattlerTarget);
        CHECK(IsBattlerAlive(battler))

        int stat = GetHighestDefendingStatId(gBattlerTarget, TRUE) == STAT_DEF ? STAT_SPATK : STAT_ATK;
        CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, stat, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER, NULL))
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_AttackerAbilityStatRaiseEnd3);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Strategic Analysis Algorithm:
The ability performs a simple but effective analysis:
- **Mixed Attackers**: Download users typically have balanced offensive stats to utilize either boost
- **Counterintuitive Logic**: Targets with high Defense get hit by special attacks, and vice versa
- **Stat Stage Awareness**: Considers opponent's stat boosts/drops in calculation

### Interaction Rules:
- **Multiple Opponents**: In doubles, only analyzes the direct opponent, not both foes
- **Substitute**: Ignores substitutes and analyzes the actual Pokémon's stats
- **Transform/Illusion**: Analyzes the apparent Pokémon's stats (what's visible)
- **Clear Body/White Smoke**: Download's boost to the user is not prevented by opponent's abilities

### Common Download Users:
1. **Porygon Line**: 
   - Porygon2: Often uses Download as an innate ability
   - Porygon-Z: Traditional Download user with high mixed offenses

2. **Genesect**: 
   - Legendary Bug/Steel type with Download
   - Can run mixed sets effectively
   - Often paired with Techno Blast for coverage

### Competitive Applications:
1. **Lead Strategies**: Immediate offensive pressure with correct coverage
2. **Mixed Attackers**: Flexibility to hit from either offensive stat
3. **Pivot Roles**: Gain momentum with U-turn/Volt Switch after boost
4. **Setup Prevention**: Forces opponents to respect both offensive stats

### Synergistic Elements:
- **Items**: Life Orb, Choice Specs/Band (locks into one attack type)
- **Moves**: Mixed coverage moves, setup moves to further boost
- **Abilities**: In Elite Redux, pairs well with offensive innate abilities

### Counterplay:
- **Balanced Defenses**: Pokémon with equal Defense/Special Defense minimize Download's effectiveness
- **Priority Moves**: Strike before Download user can utilize their boost
- **Intimidate**: Neutralizes Attack boost if Download chooses physical
- **Weather/Terrain**: Environmental damage can pressure before attacks

### Version History:
- Gen 4: Introduced with Porygon-Z
- Gen 5: Given to Genesect
- Elite Redux: Available on various Pokémon as regular or innate ability
