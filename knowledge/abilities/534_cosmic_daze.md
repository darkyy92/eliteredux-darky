# Cosmic Daze

## In-Game Description
2x damage vs confused. Enemies take 2x confusion damage.

## Extended In-Game Description (280-300 chars max)
"Cosmic Daze amplifies the disorientation of confused foes. All attacks against confused targets deal double damage, creating devastating combo potential. Additionally, confused enemies hurt themselves for double damage when hitting themselves in confusion, making confusion status especially punishing."

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Core Mechanics
Cosmic Daze is an offensive ability that enhances damage against confused targets in two ways:

1. **Double Damage vs Confused Targets**: When the user attacks a confused opponent, the damage is multiplied by 2x. This applies to all damaging moves, regardless of type or category.

2. **Double Confusion Self-Damage** (Note: Currently commented out in code): When implemented, confused opponents would take double damage when hitting themselves in confusion (80 base power instead of the standard 40).

### Activation Conditions
- **For 2x damage**: Target must have the confusion status condition
- **Damage multiplier**: Applied after all other damage calculations
- **Universal application**: Works on all damaging moves (physical, special, and fixed damage)

### Synergies
- **Confusion-inducing moves**: Confuse Ray, Swagger, Psybeam, Confusion, Hurricane, etc.
- **Abilities that cause confusion**: Intimidate variants, entry hazards with confusion effects
- **Held items**: Moves or items that can inflict confusion status

### Notable Users
- **Multiple Pokemon** have access to this ability, including some with it as an innate ability
- Often paired with other psychic or mind-affecting abilities
- Appears on Pokemon with confusion-inducing movepools

### Competitive Notes
- Creates a powerful win condition when combined with reliable confusion sources
- The 2x damage multiplier is significant and can turn weak attacks into KOs
- Confusion's inherent RNG (33% self-hit chance in Gen 7+) adds risk/reward element
- Currently, only the offensive damage boost is active; the confusion self-damage increase appears to be disabled

### Technical Implementation
- Implemented as an `onOffensiveMultiplier` effect in abilities.cc
- Checks for `STATUS2_CONFUSION` on the target
- Simple 2x multiplier (`MUL(2)`) when condition is met
- The confusion self-damage modification exists in battle_util.c but is commented out
