# Readied Action - Ability ID 557

## In-Game Description
"Doubles attack on first turn."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Readied Action doubles the Pokemon's Attack stat on the first turn after switching in. This boost applies to all physical moves used during that turn, making it excellent for immediate offensive pressure. The effect lasts only for one turn and resets upon switching out.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Activation**: Triggers automatically upon switch-in
- **Effect**: Doubles the Pokemon's Attack stat (multiplies by 2.0x) for the first turn only
- **Duration**: One turn after switch-in, then the effect disappears
- **Stat Affected**: Physical Attack stat only (not Special Attack)

### Technical Implementation
The ability works by setting two flags in the battle engine:
```c
gVolatileStructs[battler].readiedAction = TRUE;
gVolatileStructs[battler].started.readiedAction = TRUE;
```

The attack doubling occurs in the stat calculation:
```c
// In battle_util.c line 7016
if (gVolatileStructs[battler].readiedAction) statBase *= 2;
```

The flag is cleared after one turn unless it was set during switch-in:
```c
CLEAR_ONE_TURN(readiedAction)
```

### Affected Moves
- **All physical moves** (Attack stat-based moves)
- **Does NOT affect** Special Attack-based moves
- **Does NOT affect** status moves

### Interactions with Other Mechanics
- **Stacks multiplicatively** with other Attack boosts (stat stages, items, etc.)
- **Works with** Choice Band, Life Orb, and other damage-boosting items
- **Compatible with** other abilities that boost Attack (though the Pokemon can only have one main ability)
- **Burn status** still halves Attack after the Readied Action boost is applied
- **Intimidate** and other Attack-lowering effects apply after the doubling

### Strategic Implications
- **Immediate threat**: Forces opponents to respect first-turn damage potential
- **Switch-in pressure**: Makes the Pokemon dangerous immediately upon entry
- **One-time use**: Must be used wisely as the effect only lasts one turn
- **Prediction reward**: Benefits from correctly predicting opponent's moves/switches

### Example Damage Calculations
Assuming a Pokemon with 100 base Attack using a 100 BP physical move:
- **Normal**: ~200 damage (approximate)
- **With Readied Action**: ~400 damage (approximate)
- **With Readied Action + Choice Band**: ~600 damage (approximate)

### Common Users
Based on the ability implementation, this would typically be found on:
- Physical attackers that benefit from immediate pressure
- Pokemon with good switch-in opportunities
- Wallbreakers that need the extra power to break through defensive cores

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Lead potential**: Strong on leads for immediate pressure
- **Revenge killing**: Excellent for coming in after a teammate faints
- **Wallbreaking**: Can break through physically defensive Pokemon
- **Momentum control**: Creates immediate threats that force switches

### Counters
- **Physical walls**: High Defense Pokemon can still tank the boosted attack
- **Intimidate users**: Reduce the Attack boost (though it's still doubled from the reduced amount)
- **Priority moves**: Can bypass the need to tank the first-turn attack
- **Status moves**: Sleep, paralysis, or other status can waste the boost turn

### Synergies
- **Choice items**: Stacks with Choice Band for massive damage
- **Life Orb**: Additional damage boost for even more power
- **Type-boosting items**: Plates, expert belts, etc. for type-specific damage
- **High Attack stats**: Pokemon with naturally high Attack benefit most

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Custom ability implementation
- **Unique mechanic**: First-turn Attack doubling provides immediate offensive presence

- **Pure Power**: Similar permanent Attack boost
