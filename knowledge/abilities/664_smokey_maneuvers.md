# Smokey Maneuvers

**Base Description:** Evasion is boosted by 1.25x in fog.

**Extended Description:** This Pokemon has mastered the art of combat in low visibility conditions. When fog weather is active on the battlefield, the Pokemon becomes harder to hit by using the obscured environment to its advantage. Fog reduces incoming attack accuracy by 25%, making this an elusive target.
