# Protosynthesis - Ability ID 548

## In-Game Description
"Boosts highest stat in Sun or with Booster Energy."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Protosynthesis boosts the Pokemon's highest stat by 50% for Speed or 30% for other stats during any form of sun weather. Works with regular sun, permanent sun, and Desolate Land. When sun ends, switches to Booster Energy if held. Highest stat is recalculated each activation.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Protosynthesis is a Paradox ability that provides significant stat boosts under specific conditions. The ability operates through a sophisticated state system that tracks the boost source and targeted stat.

### Activation Conditions
1. **Sun Weather**: Activates when any form of sun weather is present:
   - `WEATHER_SUN_TEMPORARY`: Regular sun (5 turns)
   - `WEATHER_SUN_PERMANENT`: Permanent sun (Drought, etc.)
   - `WEATHER_SUN_PRIMAL`: Desolate Land (Primal Groudon)

2. **Booster Energy**: Activates when holding Booster Energy item, regardless of weather

### Stat Boost Calculation
- **Speed**: Multiplied by 1.5 (50% increase)
- **All other stats**: Multiplied by 1.3 (30% increase)

### Highest Stat Detection
The ability uses `GetHighestStatId(battler, TRUE)` which:
- Compares all stats (Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed)
- Includes current stat stage modifications in the comparison
- Recalculates on each activation, not just once per battle
- Returns the stat with the highest current value

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
// Stat boost application
if (statId == STAT_SPEED)
    *stat *= 1.5;
else
    *stat *= 1.3;

// Activation check for sun weather
if (state.source == PARADOX_BOOST_NOT_ACTIVE && IsWeatherActive(WEATHER_SUN_ANY))
```

### Priority System
1. **Sun Weather**: Primary activation source
2. **Booster Energy Transition**: When sun ends but Booster Energy is held
3. **Direct Booster Energy**: When no sun is active but item is held

### State Management
- `PARADOX_BOOST_NOT_ACTIVE`: No boost currently active
- `PARADOX_WEATHER_ACTIVE`: Boost from sun weather
- `PARADOX_BOOSTER_ENERGY`: Boost from Booster Energy item

### Interactions with Other Mechanics
- **Stat Stages**: Included in highest stat calculation
- **Weather Immunity**: Pokemon must be affected by weather for sun activation
- **Item Removal**: Booster Energy is consumed when used
- **Ability Suppression**: Can be suppressed by Neutralizing Gas, etc.

### Strategic Implications
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Highest stat changes based on current battle state
- **Weather Synergy**: Excellent on sun teams with Drought users
- **Item Flexibility**: Can function without weather support via Booster Energy
- **Speed Control**: Often boosts Speed on naturally fast Pokemon
- **Bulk Enhancement**: Can boost defensive stats on bulky Pokemon

### Example Scenarios
**Scenario 1**: Pokemon with base stats 100/80/120/90/110
- In sun: Sp. Attack boosted to 120 x 1.3 = 156
- If Speed becomes highest after stat changes: Speed boosted to 110 x 1.5 = 165

**Scenario 2**: Weather transition
- Sun active to Protosynthesis boosts highest stat
- Sun ends to If holding Booster Energy, immediately switches to item boost
- No weather, no item to Ability inactive

### Common Users
Primarily designed for Paradox Pokemon but available to others in Elite Redux:
- Future Paradox forms (Great Tusk, Scream Tail, etc.)
- Pokemon with varied stat distributions
- Sun team members wanting flexible boosts

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Team Building**: Excellent on sun teams or with Booster Energy support
- **Stat Optimization**: Consider which stat is likely to be highest
- **Weather Control**: Pairs well with Drought users
- **Item Choice**: Booster Energy provides backup activation

### Counters
- **Weather Removal**: Changing weather removes sun-based boost
- **Ability Suppression**: Neutralizing Gas, Mold Breaker effects
- **Item Removal**: Knock Off, Trick remove Booster Energy
- **Stat Reduction**: Lowering stats can change which is highest

### Synergies
- **Sun Setters**: Drought, Desolate Land users
- **Weather Extenders**: Heat Rock extends sun duration
- **Stat Boosters**: Moves that raise stats can influence which gets boosted
- **Speed Control**: Pairs with other speed-boosting effects

### Version History
- Added in Elite Redux as a signature Paradox ability
- Shares mechanics with Quark Drive (Electric Terrain version)
- Part of the modern Paradox Pokemon design philosophy
