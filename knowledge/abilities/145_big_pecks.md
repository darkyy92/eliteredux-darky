# Big Pecks - Ability ID 145

## In-Game Description
"Boosts the power of contact moves by 1.3x."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Big Pecks boosts the power of all contact moves by 30%. This includes physical attacks like Tackle, Scratch, and Bite, as well as special contact moves like Grass Knot. The damage boost applies to any move that makes direct physical contact with the opponent.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Big Pecks in Elite Redux has been completely reworked from its vanilla effect (which prevented Defense stat reduction). The new implementation provides a 1.3x (30%) multiplier to the power of any move that makes contact with the target.

### Technical Details:
- **Contact Detection**: Uses `IsMoveMakingContact(move, battler)` to determine if a move makes contact
- **Damage Calculation**: Applied during the offensive multiplier phase of damage calculation
- **Move Types**: Affects both physical and special moves that make contact
- **Stacking**: This multiplier stacks with other damage-boosting effects like STAB, type effectiveness, and items

### Contact Move Examples:
- **Physical**: Tackle, Quick Attack, Scratch, Bite, Thunder Punch, Ice Punch
- **Special**: Grass Knot, Petal Dance (if it makes contact in this hack)
- **Status**: Does not affect non-damaging moves

### Pokemon That Learn Big Pecks:
Big Pecks is typically found on bird Pokemon and other creatures with prominent beaks or claws, making thematic sense for enhanced contact-based attacks.

### Competitive Usage:
This ability transforms Big Pecks into a powerful offensive tool, making it particularly valuable for Pokemon with strong contact move pools. The 30% boost is significant enough to change damage calculations and KO thresholds in competitive play.
