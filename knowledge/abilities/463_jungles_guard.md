# Jungle's Guard - Ability ID 463

## In-Game Description
"Protects Grass-type allies from status and stat drops."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Jungle's Guard shields Grass-type allies from status conditions and stat drops while healing the user's status at the end of each turn during sun. Combines Flower Veil protection with Leaf Guard healing. Ideal for sun teams needing comprehensive status and stat protection for Grass allies.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Jungle's Guard is a hybrid ability that combines the protective capabilities of Flower Veil with the healing properties of Leaf Guard. It provides both team support for Grass-type allies and self-healing for the user.

### Flower Veil Component (Team Protection)
- **Status Immunity**: Prevents all major status conditions from affecting Grass-type allies
  - Sleep, poison, burn, paralysis, freeze, and bleed
  - Uses `CHECK_STATUS1` flag system for comprehensive protection
- **Stat Drop Protection**: Blocks all stat reductions to Grass-type allies
  - Protects Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion
  - Counters Intimidate, stat-lowering moves, and ability-based stat drops
- **Application Rules**:
  - Only affects Grass-type Pokemon on the same side as the ability user
  - Does NOT protect the user unless they are also Grass-type
  - Can be bypassed by Mold Breaker and similar abilities
  - Works passively without turn activation requirement

### Leaf Guard Component (Self-Healing)
- **Status Healing**: Cures the user's own status conditions at the end of each turn during sunny weather
  - Works with regular sun, harsh sunlight (Drought), and extremely harsh sunlight (Desolate Land)
  - Removes burn, freeze, paralysis, poison, and sleep
  - Activates after damage from burn/poison is taken
- **Weather Requirement**: Only functions when any form of sun weather is active
- **Timing**: End-of-turn effect, after other turn-end processes

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
// Jungle's Guard uses FlowerVeil's protection system
constexpr Ability JunglesGuard = {
    .onStatusImmune = FlowerVeil.onStatusImmune,      // Status protection for allies
    .onStatusImmuneFor = FlowerVeil.onStatusImmuneFor, // APPLY_ON_ALLY flag
    .breakable = TRUE,
};
```

### Battle Script Integration
- **Stat Protection**: Handled via `IsFlowerVeilProtected()` function in battle script commands
- **Sun Healing**: Integrated with `IsLeafGuardProtected()` function for weather-based healing
- **Dual Functionality**: Ability is recognized by both protection systems

### Activation Conditions
1. **Team Protection**: Always active for Grass-type allies (weather-independent)
2. **Self-Healing**: Only active for the user during sunny weather conditions
3. **Type Restriction**: Protection only applies to Grass-type Pokemon
4. **Weather Dependency**: Healing component requires active sun weather

### Strategic Implications
- **Sun Team Core**: Essential ability for sun-based Grass teams
- **Dual Role**: Provides both support and self-sustaining capabilities
- **Type Synergy**: Perfect for Grass-type Pokemon who benefit from sun
- **Weather Extension**: Pairs well with Heat Rock for longer sun duration
- **Team Composition**: Encourages Grass-heavy team builds

### Important Interactions
- **Status Damage**: Burn and poison damage still occurs before healing
- **Stat Drop Messages**: Displays protection messages when blocking stat reductions
- **Weather Override**: Healing component disabled if sun is removed
- **Ability Suppression**: Both components disabled by Mold Breaker effects
- **Multiple Allies**: Can protect multiple Grass-type teammates simultaneously

### Competitive Analysis

#### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Protection**: Covers both status and stat immunity for team
2. **Self-Sustaining**: Provides personal status recovery in optimal weather
3. **Weather Synergy**: Perfect for sun teams needing status security
4. **Team Support**: Excellent doubles ability for Grass-type cores
5. **Consistent Activation**: Protection works regardless of weather

#### Weaknesses
1. **Type Restriction**: Only protects Grass-type Pokemon
2. **Weather Dependent**: Healing requires sun to be active
3. **Breakable**: Countered by Mold Breaker and similar abilities
4. **Limited Self-Protection**: User must be Grass-type to benefit from protection
5. **Weather Competition**: Vulnerable to weather override strategies

### Common Usage Scenarios
- **Sun Sweeper Support**: Protecting Grass-type setup sweepers from status/stats
- **Doubles Cores**: Supporting powerful Grass attackers in doubles formats
- **Status Immunity**: Creating pseudo-immunity to common status strategies
- **Anti-Intimidate**: Protecting physical Grass attackers from Attack drops
- **Weather Teams**: Core member of sun-based team compositions

### Synergistic Abilities and Moves
- **Drought/Sunny Day**: Essential for healing component activation
- **Solar Beam/Solar Blade**: No charge in same weather conditions
- **Synthesis/Moonlight**: Enhanced recovery in sunny weather
- **Growth**: Doubled stat boosts during sun weather
- **Chlorophyll**: Speed doubling complements status immunity

### Counters and Counterplay
- **Weather Override**: Primal Kyogre, sand/hail setters disable healing
- **Non-Grass Types**: Ability provides no protection to other types
- **Mold Breaker**: Bypasses both protection and healing components
- **Cloud Nine/Air Lock**: Negates weather for healing component
- **Entry Hazards**: Not affected by Jungle's Guard protection

### Related Abilities
- **Flower Veil**: Provides identical team protection without healing
- **Leaf Guard**: Offers same healing without team protection
- **Aroma Veil**: Protects team from move restrictions (Taunt, Encore)
- **Sweet Veil**: Prevents sleep for entire team regardless of type

### Pokemon That Learn This Ability
*Note: Specific Pokemon assignments would need to be verified in species data files*

### Battle Messages
- **Status Protection**: "The veil of petals protected [Pokemon] from status!"
- **Stat Protection**: "[Pokemon] surrounded itself with a veil of petals!"  
- **Status Healing**: "[Pokemon]'s status was healed by the sunny weather!"

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Custom ability combining Flower Veil and Leaf Guard
- **Implementation**: Uses existing battle systems for both components
- **Balance**: Restricted to Grass-types to prevent overpowered usage

### Notes
- Ability ID 463 in the Elite Redux ability enum system
- Uses `ABILITY_JUNGLES_GUARD` constant throughout codebase
- Integrates with both `IsFlowerVeilProtected()` and `IsLeafGuardProtected()` functions
- Weather duration in Elite Redux is 8 turns, making healing more reliable
- Can be combined with other abilities as an innate ability in the 4-ability system
