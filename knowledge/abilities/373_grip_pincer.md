# Grip Pincer

## In-Game Description
"50% chance to trap. Then ignores Defense & accuracy checks."

## Extended In-Game Description (280-300 chars)
"Contact moves have a 50% chance to trap the target (like Wrap), preventing escape or switching. Against trapped targets, the attacker's moves ignore defensive stats and always hit. Trapped targets take 1/8 max HP damage each turn. Trap lasts 4-5 turns (7 with Grip Claw)."

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Trap Application
- **Trigger**: Activates when the ability holder uses a contact move
- **Application Chance**: 50% chance to apply trap status (STATUS2_WRAPPED)
- **Stack Prevention**: Cannot trap already-trapped targets
- **Target Requirement**: Target must be alive and affected by on-hit effects

### Trap Duration
- **Base Duration**: 4-5 turns (randomly chosen)
- **With Grip Claw**: 7 turns
- **Turn Counter**: Decreases at the end of each turn

### Trap Effects
1. **Movement Restriction**: 
   - Trapped Pokémon cannot switch out or flee
   - Ghost-types are still trapped (unlike Gen 6+ mechanics for regular trapping moves)
   - Shed Shell allows escape despite trap

2. **End-of-Turn Damage**:
   - Deals 1/8 of target's max HP at the end of each turn
   - Damage is dealt for the duration of the trap
   - Magic Guard prevents this damage

3. **Battle Advantages for Attacker**:
   - **Accuracy Bypass**: All moves from the Grip Pincer user against trapped targets automatically hit
   - **Defense Ignore**: Physical and special moves ignore the target's defensive stat stages when calculating damage
   - These benefits only apply to the Pokémon with Grip Pincer, not its allies

### Interaction Details
- The trap is linked to the specific move that triggered it
- If the Grip Pincer user faints, the trap persists until its natural expiration
- Multiple sources of trapping do not stack - only one trap can be active
- The ability popup shows when trap damage is dealt

### Strategic Implications
- Excellent for trapping and eliminating specific threats
- Synergizes with multi-hit moves for multiple trap chances
- Pairs well with Grip Claw for extended trap duration
- The defense-ignoring effect makes it easier to KO trapped defensive Pokémon
- Guaranteed hits prevent evasion strategies from trapped opponents
