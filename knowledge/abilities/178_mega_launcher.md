## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
**Mega Launcher** provides a significant **1.3x damage multiplier** to an extensive range of moves, plus special interactions with healing moves.

### Core Mechanics

#### Damage Boost
- **Multiplier**: 1.3x damage to qualifying moves
- **Implementation**: Applied via `onOffensiveMultiplier` in abilities.cc

#### Move Selection Logic
Mega Launcher boosts moves through multiple criteria:
1. **FLAG_MEGA_LAUNCHER_BOOST moves**: Any move with this specific flag
2. **All Status moves**: Every status move gets boosted regardless of name or type
3. **Gunman ability interaction**: If the user has Gunman ability, all status moves are treated as Mega Launcher moves

### Heal Pulse Special Enhancement
**Heal Pulse** receives unique treatment with Mega Launcher:
- **Normal**: Heals 50% of target's max HP
- **Mega Launcher Boosted**: Heals **75% of target's max HP**
- **Implementation**: Special code in battle_script_commands.c checks for Mega Launcher boost and increases healing

```c
if (megaLauncherBoosted)
    gBattleMoveDamage = -(gBattleMons[gActiveBattler].maxHP * 3 / 4);  // 75%
else
    gBattleMoveDamage = -(gBattleMons[gActiveBattler].maxHP / 2);      // 50%
```
