# Teraform Zero - Ability ID 739

## In-Game Description
"Tera Shell + clears weather and terrain on first entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Teraform Zero reduces super effective damage to 50% when at full HP like Tera Shell, and clears all weather and terrain upon first entry. Only activates once per battle entry. Provides both defensive protection and field control by neutralizing environmental hazards.

*Character count: 285*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Teraform Zero is a hybrid defensive/utility ability that combines two distinct effects:
1. **Tera Shell component**: Damage reduction when at full HP
2. **Field clearing component**: Removes weather and terrain on first entry

### Tera Shell Component
- **Damage reduction**: Reduces super effective moves to 50% damage when at full HP
- **HP requirement**: Only works when the Pokémon is at maximum HP
- **Type coverage**: Affects all super effective attacks regardless of type
- **Breakable**: Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker and similar abilities

### Field Clearing Component
- **Activation**: Triggers only on first entry per battle
- **Single use**: Uses the single-use ability counter system
- **Weather clearing**: Removes all active weather conditions:
  - Sun, Rain, Sandstorm, Hail
  - Harsh sunlight, Heavy rain
  - Desolate Land, Primordial Sea effects
- **Terrain clearing**: Removes all active terrain effects:
  - Electric Terrain, Grassy Terrain
  - Misty Terrain, Psychic Terrain
  - Any custom terrains

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability TeraformZero = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK(!GetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability));
        SetSingleUseAbilityCounter(battler, ability, TRUE);
        CHECK(IsWeatherActive(WEATHER_ANY) || IsTerrainActive(STATUS_FIELD_TERRAIN_ANY))
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_TeraformZero);
        return TRUE;
    },
    .onAfterTypeEffectiveness = TeraShell.onAfterTypeEffectiveness,
    .onAfterTypeEffectivenessFor = TeraShell.onAfterTypeEffectivenessFor,
    .breakable = TRUE,
};
```

### Battle Script Behavior
The `BattleScript_TeraformZero` script:
1. First attempts to remove weather using `removeweather`
2. If weather was cleared, displays appropriate weather ending message
3. Then attempts to remove terrain using `removeterrain`
4. If terrain was cleared, displays appropriate terrain ending message

### Activation Conditions
- **Entry requirement**: Must be switching in or entering battle
- **Single use**: Only works on first entry per battle
- **Field check**: Only activates if weather or terrain is actually present
- **Priority**: Activates before other entry abilities that depend on weather/terrain

### Important Interactions
- **Multi-entry limitation**: Won't activate on subsequent entries in same battle
- **U-turn/Volt Switch**: Won't reactivate if switching back in
- **Revive/Healing**: Won't reactivate after fainting and revival
- **Form changes**: Single-use counter persists through form changes
- **Tera Shell inheritance**: Full HP requirement applies to damage reduction

### Weather/Terrain Priority
- **Override ability**: Takes priority over weather/terrain setting abilities
- **Immediate clearing**: Removes fields before other entry abilities can benefit
- **Message display**: Shows clearing messages before ability activation message
- **Permanent removal**: Fields stay cleared until manually reset

### Strategic Implications

#### Offensive Applications
- **Field control**: Disrupts weather/terrain-based strategies
- **Revenge killing**: Can switch in safely with damage reduction at full HP
- **Counter-setup**: Removes opponent's field advantages
- **Utility switching**: Provides safe entry against super effective coverage

#### Defensive Applications  
- **Tank role**: Survives super effective hits at full HP
- **Pivot utility**: Can switch in and clear problematic fields
- **Anti-setup**: Disrupts weather/terrain sweepers
- **One-time protection**: Gives free switch-in opportunity

#### Team Synergy
- **Weather teams**: Can reset opponent's weather for your own setter
- **Terrain teams**: Clears opposing terrain for your own terrain
- **Bulky pivots**: Excellent on defensive pivots and tanks
- **Lead potential**: Can lead to disrupt opposing setup strategies

### Counters and Limitations

#### Direct Counters
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas disable both components
- **Multi-hit moves**: Can break through Tera Shell component
- **Status moves**: Tera Shell doesn't protect against status effects
- **Entry hazards**: Damage from hazards can break full HP requirement

#### Strategic Limitations
- **One-time use**: Field clearing only works once per battle
- **HP dependency**: Tera Shell component requires full HP
- **Priority moves**: High priority moves still deal full damage
- **Residual damage**: Poison, burn, etc. disable Tera Shell component

#### Situational Weaknesses
- **No weather/terrain**: Entry component does nothing if no fields active
- **Late game**: Less valuable once single use is expended
- **Chip damage**: Any prior damage negates Tera Shell protection
- **Prediction reliance**: Requires good prediction for optimal switching

### Common Users and Archetypes
- **Bulky pivots**: Pokémon that frequently switch in
- **Defensive walls**: Tanks that need protection from super effective hits
- **Field controllers**: Pokémon focused on disrupting opponent strategies
- **Revenge killers**: Fast attackers that need safe entry opportunities

### Competitive Viability
- **High utility**: Combination of defense and field control is unique
- **Meta dependent**: Value depends on prevalence of weather/terrain teams
- **Switch advantage**: Provides immediate board control on entry
- **Resource management**: Single-use nature requires strategic timing

### Synergistic Abilities (for multi-ability Pokémon)
- **Weather/terrain setters**: Can clear opponent's field then set your own
- **Speed control**: Abilities that help capitalize on safe entry
- **Recovery abilities**: Help maintain full HP for Tera Shell component
- **Status immunity**: Prevents status from breaking HP requirement

### Version History
- **Elite Redux exclusive**: Custom ability not found in official games
- **Modern implementation**: Uses single-use counter system
- **Tera Shell integration**: Inherits exact mechanics from base Tera Shell
- **Field clearing**: Uses standard weather/terrain removal scripts
