# Clueless - Ability ID 426

## In-Game Description
"Negates Weather, Rooms and Terrains."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Clueless negates all weather, terrain, and room effects while active on the field. Blocks sun, rain, sandstorm, hail, and all terrain types. Prevents Trick Room, Wonder Room, Magic Room, Inverse Room, and Gravity. Provides complete immunity to field-altering effects and environmental conditions.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Clueless is a powerful field control ability that completely nullifies weather, terrain, and room effects while the Pokemon is on the battlefield. It functions similarly to Cloud Nine and Air Lock but with expanded coverage to include terrain and room effects.

### Effects Negated
- **Weather Effects**: All weather conditions are negated
  - Sun/Sunny Day/Drought/Desolate Land
  - Rain/Drizzle/Primordial Sea
  - Sandstorm/Sand Stream
  - Hail/Snow Warning
  - Strong winds from Delta Stream
- **Terrain Effects**: All terrain types are blocked
  - Electric Terrain
  - Grassy Terrain
  - Psychic Terrain
  - Misty Terrain
- **Room Effects**: All room-based field effects are negated
  - Trick Room (speed priority reversal)
  - Wonder Room (Defense/Sp. Defense stat swap)
  - Magic Room (held item negation)
  - Inverse Room (type effectiveness reversal)
  - Gravity (grounding and accuracy changes)

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Clueless inherits from CloudNine's entry effect
constexpr Ability Clueless = {
    .onEntry = CloudNine.onEntry,  // Announces ability activation
    .unsuppressable = TRUE,        // Cannot be suppressed
};

// Weather negation check
#define WEATHER_HAS_EFFECT \
    (!gFieldTimers.clearSkiesTimer && !IsAbilityOnField(ABILITY_CLOUD_NINE) && 
     !IsAbilityOnField(ABILITY_AIR_LOCK) && !IsAbilityOnField(ABILITY_CLUELESS))

// Terrain negation check
#define TERRAIN_HAS_EFFECT (!IsAbilityOnField(ABILITY_CLUELESS))

// Room effect checks
bool8 IsTrickRoomActive(void) {
    if (IsAbilityOnField(ABILITY_CLUELESS))
        return FALSE;
    // ... other checks
}
```

### Activation Conditions
- **Presence-based**: Simply being on the field is enough
- **Field-wide**: Affects the entire battlefield, not just the user
- **Immediate**: Takes effect as soon as the Pokemon enters battle
- **Continuous**: Remains active while the Pokemon is on the field
- **Unsuppressable**: Cannot be suppressed by abilities like Mold Breaker

### Strategic Implications
- **Ultimate field control**: Completely resets battlefield conditions
- **Weather team counter**: Shuts down sun, rain, sand, and hail strategies
- **Terrain denial**: Blocks Electric, Grassy, Psychic, and Misty Terrain
- **Room breaker**: Counters Trick Room and other room-based strategies
- **Neutral battlefield**: Forces battles to rely on raw stats and movesets

### Interactions and Mechanics
- **Entry announcement**: Displays message when entering battle
- **Immediate effect**: All field effects are negated instantly upon entry
- **Switching**: Effects return when Clueless user switches out
- **Multiple users**: Multiple Clueless users maintain the negation
- **Priority immunity**: Unsuppressable trait prevents ability negation

### Competitive Usage
- **Anti-setup**: Excellent against weather, terrain, and room-based teams
- **Neutral game**: Forces opponents to rely on natural advantages
- **Switching utility**: Can be brought in to reset problematic field conditions
- **Team building**: Requires careful consideration of your own weather/terrain needs
- **Versatile counter**: Single ability counters multiple strategies

### Synergies
- **Raw power**: Pairs well with Pokemon that don't rely on field effects
- **Speed control**: Natural speed becomes more important without Trick Room
- **Stat boosting**: Moves like Swords Dance become more valuable
- **Coverage moves**: Diverse movesets become more important
- **Entry hazards**: Unaffected by Clueless, remain viable

### Counters
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker variants (though ability is unsuppressable)
- **KO pressure**: Eliminate the Clueless user to restore field effects
- **Multiple setters**: Can reset conditions after Clueless switches out
- **Direct damage**: Doesn't protect against raw damage output
- **Status moves**: Status conditions still work normally

### Common Users
- Pokemon that benefit from neutral battlefield conditions
- Anti-meta picks against weather/terrain teams
- Bulky Pokemon that can afford the utility slot
- Pokemon with strong natural stats that don't need field boosts

### Version History
- Elite Redux exclusive ability
- Expanded version of Cloud Nine/Air Lock concepts
- Designed to counter multiple field effect strategies simultaneously
- Unsuppressable trait prevents common counters

### Technical Notes
- Inherits Cloud Nine's entry script for battle announcements
- Uses IsAbilityOnField() checks in multiple battle utility functions
- Integrated into weather, terrain, and room effect macros
- Cannot be suppressed due to unsuppressable flag
- Effects are immediate and continuous while on field
