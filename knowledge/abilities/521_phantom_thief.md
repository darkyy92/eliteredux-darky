# Phantom Thief - Ability ID 521

## In-Game Description
"Attacks with 40BP Spectral Thief on switch-in."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Phantom Thief automatically uses a 40 BP Spectral Thief when switching in, targeting a random opponent. Steals all positive stat boosts from the target and applies them to the user. Ghost-type attack benefits from STAB on Ghost-types. Cannot miss and ignores Substitute.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Phantom Thief is an aggressive entry ability that automatically uses a modified version of Spectral Thief when the Pokemon switches into battle, forcing immediate offensive pressure and stat theft.

### Activation Conditions
- **Trigger**: Activates immediately upon switching into battle
- **Target selection**: Targets a random opponent in battle
- **Move properties**: Uses Spectral Thief with 40 BP instead of normal 90 BP
- **Type**: Ghost-type physical attack
- **Accuracy**: Cannot miss (ability-triggered moves bypass accuracy)

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability PhantomThief = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int { 
        return UseEntryMove(battler, ability, MOVE_SPECTRAL_THIEF, 40); 
    },
};
```

The ability uses the `UseEntryMove` function to execute Spectral Thief with reduced power on switch-in.

### Spectral Thief Mechanics
Based on the move's implementation:
- **Stat stealing**: Takes all positive stat boosts (+1 to +6) from the target
- **Stat application**: Applies stolen boosts to the user, up to +6 maximum
- **Stat reset**: Target's boosted stats are reset to neutral (0)
- **Contact move**: Makes contact for abilities like Static, Flame Body
- **Affected stats**: Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, Evasion

### Important Interactions
- **STAB bonus**: Ghost-type users get 1.5x damage (40 BP becomes 60 effective BP)
- **Substitute piercing**: Spectral Thief bypasses Substitute to steal stats
- **Multi-target**: In doubles, targets one random opponent
- **Priority**: No priority; uses standard switch-in timing
- **Damage calculation**: Uses user's Attack stat and target's Defense stat

### Strategic Implications
- **Setup punisher**: Punishes opponents who try to set up stat boosts
- **Immediate pressure**: Forces damage and disruption on switch-in
- **Momentum swing**: Can steal crucial stat boosts and turn them against opponent
- **Entry hazard synergy**: Combines with hazard damage for KO potential
- **Mind games**: Opponents must consider stat boost timing carefully

### Defensive Counterplay
- **Ghost immunity**: Normal and Fighting types immune to the Ghost-type attack
- **Protect/Detect**: Can block the entry move if predicted
- **Intimidate**: Can reduce the incoming damage by lowering Attack
- **Rocky Helmet**: Deals contact damage back to the user
- **Rough Skin/Iron Barbs**: Punishes the contact move

### Common Users
Based on the ability ID (521), this is likely found on:
- Ghost-type Pokemon with thieving/sneaky themes
- Pokemon with high Attack stats to maximize damage
- Fast Pokemon who can capitalize on stolen Speed boosts
- Pokemon designed to disrupt setup strategies

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Setup counter**: Excellent against setup sweepers and calm mind users
- **Pivot tool**: Can steal stats then pivot out with U-turn/Volt Switch
- **Early game pressure**: Creates immediate threats when switching in
- **Double battles**: Random targeting can disrupt opponent's strategy
- **Risk/reward**: Exposes user to retaliation but gains stolen stats

### Synergies
- **Choice items**: Can immediately use stolen stats with locked moves
- **Life Orb**: Boosts the entry move damage significantly
- **Entry hazards**: Combines damage for potential KOs
- **Pivot moves**: Steal stats then switch out to preserve them
- **Priority moves**: Use stolen Speed to outspeed and attack

### Counters
- **Ghost immunity**: Normal/Fighting types completely avoid the effect
- **Protective moves**: Protect, Detect, Spiky Shield block the move
- **Clear Body/White Smoke**: Prevents stat theft (target keeps boosts)
- **Hyper Cutter**: Protects Attack stat from being stolen
- **Contact punishment**: Abilities that punish contact moves

### Version History
- Elite Redux custom ability (ID 521)
- Part of the expanded ability roster beyond Generation VIII
- Uses existing Spectral Thief mechanics with entry trigger
- Reduced power balances the automatic activation

### Technical Notes
- Uses MOVE_SPECTRAL_THIEF (ID 666) with modified 40 BP
- Triggers through onEntry ability hook
- Benefits from all normal move mechanics (STAB, items, etc.)
- Subject to normal battle mechanics and type effectiveness
