# Dauntless Shield - Ability ID 235

## In-Game Description
"On entry, raises Defense by one stage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Dauntless Shield immediately raises the Pokémon's Defense by one stage when it enters battle. This boost applies to all forms of entry including switching in, starting battles, and reviving. The defense increase stacks with other stat boosts and cannot be prevented by Clear Body or similar abilities.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Dauntless Shield is an entry-based ability that provides an immediate defensive boost upon entering battle. Here's how it works:

### Activation Conditions
- Triggers when the Pokémon enters battle through any means:
  - Normal switching
  - Battle start
  - Revival from fainting
  - Forced switching (Roar, Whirlwind, etc.)

### Mechanics
- Raises Defense by exactly 1 stage (+50% Defense)
- Uses the standard stat boost system (same as Defense Curl, Harden, etc.)
- Cannot be prevented by abilities like Clear Body or White Smoke
- Will not activate if Defense is already at maximum (+6 stages)
- Stacks with other Defense boosts and items

### Strategic Applications
- Provides immediate bulk for defensive Pokémon
- Particularly valuable on switch-ins to resist physical attacks
- Synergizes well with other defensive abilities and items
- Most effective on Pokémon with already high Defense stats

### Interactions
- Works with Eviolite and other defensive items
- Stacks with other stat-boosting abilities
- Can be copied by Trace but not by abilities like Skill Swap
- Unaffected by Mold Breaker or similar abilities

### Elite Redux Context
In Elite Redux's 4-ability system, Dauntless Shield appears as both a regular ability and an innate ability on various defensive Pokémon, providing consistent defensive utility alongside other abilities. It's particularly common on Steel-type and defensive Pokémon that benefit from the immediate bulk increase.

The ability is implemented using the standard onEntry callback system and uses the same stat modification mechanics as other stat-boosting abilities in the game.
