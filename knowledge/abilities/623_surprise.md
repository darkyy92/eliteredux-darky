# Surprise! (Ability #623)

**Type:** Weather-dependent priority counter  
**Activation:** Fog weather only

## Core Mechanics

In fog weather, when an opponent uses a move targeting multiple battlers or allies, this ability triggers an automatic Astonish attack (40 power, Ghost-type, 100% accuracy) against them before their move executes. The Astonish has a high flinch chance, potentially preventing the opponent's move entirely.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*
In fog weather conditions, this ability detects opponents using moves that target multiple battlers or allies. Upon detection, the user immediately counters with Astonish, a 40-power Ghost-type attack that has a high flinch chance, potentially disrupting the opponent's strategies.

## Strategic Applications

- **Priority Disruption:** Counters priority moves in fog weather
- **Weather Synergy:** Requires fog to activate, making it situational
- **Flinch Control:** Uses Astonish's flinch effect to disrupt opponent timing
- **Multi-target Counter:** Specifically triggers against moves with broad targeting

## Battle Interactions

- Only works in fog weather conditions
- Triggers before opponent's move resolves
- Uses Astonish's standard damage calculation and flinch rate
- Cannot be prevented by typical priority-blocking abilities

## Competitive Viability

**Fog Weather Teams:** Excellent in fog-based strategies  
**Counter-Meta:** Disrupts multi-target and priority strategies  
**Setup Disruption:** Prevents opponent setup moves through flinching
