# Hyper Cleanse - Extended Description

Hyper Cleanse provides comprehensive protection against status ailments while offering defensive benefits against poison-type attacks. This ability grants complete immunity to all major status conditions including burn, poison, paralysis, sleep, and freeze. When a Pokémon with Hyper Cleanse is inflicted with any status condition, the ability automatically cleanses it, preventing the status from taking effect. Additionally, Hyper Cleanse reduces damage from poison-type moves by 50%, making the Pokémon highly resistant to toxic strategies. The ability is breakable by moves like Mold Breaker but provides reliable protection in most battle scenarios.
