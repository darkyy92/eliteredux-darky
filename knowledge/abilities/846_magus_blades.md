# Magus Blades

Combines magical and physical blade mastery. Slash moves (cutting/blade attacks) and launcher-boosted moves hit twice. These attacks gain 30% power boost and can use Special Defense as the attacking stat (adds 20% of SpDef to damage). Physical slash moves can be calculated as special attacks.
