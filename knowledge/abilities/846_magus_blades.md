# Magus Blades - Ability ID 846

## In-Game Description
Combines magical and physical blade mastery with enhanced slashing attacks.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Keen Edge moves become Special (deal Special damage and use the Special Attack stat) and use 20% of the user's Special Defense stat for attack calculations. Also, Keen Edge moves hit twice, dealing 70% of the move's normal damage. Secondary effects roll independently for each hit (except flinch).

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
Combines magical and physical blade mastery. Slash moves (cutting/blade attacks) and launcher-boosted moves hit twice. These attacks gain 30% power boost and can use Special Defense as the attacking stat (adds 20% of SpDef to damage). Physical slash moves can be calculated as special attacks.
