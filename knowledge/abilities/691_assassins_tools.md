# Assassin's Tools

**ID:** 691  
**Official Description:** Contact moves have a 30% chance to PSN, PRLZ, or BLD.

## Extended In-Game Description
Like a master assassin's arsenal, this ability turns every physical strike into a potentially deadly encounter. When the Pok√©mon lands contact moves, there's a 30% chance of inflicting poison, paralysis, or bleeding on the target, chosen randomly from these three debilitating effects.
