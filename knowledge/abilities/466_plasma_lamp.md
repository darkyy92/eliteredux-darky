# Plasma Lamp - Ability ID 466

## In-Game Description
"Boost accuracy & power of Fire & Electric type moves by 1.2x."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Plasma Lamp boosts both power and accuracy of Fire and Electric-type moves by 20% each. The power boost affects damage calculations while the accuracy boost reduces the chance of missing. Works on all Fire moves like Flamethrower and Electric moves like Thunderbolt. Ideal for mixed attackers.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Plasma Lamp is an offensive ability that provides dual benefits to Fire and Electric-type moves: a 20% power boost and a 20% accuracy boost. Both effects apply simultaneously to qualifying moves.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move type requirement**: Only affects Fire-type and Electric-type moves
- **Dual effect**: Both power and accuracy bonuses apply to the same move
- **Always active**: No weather, health, or turn-based conditions required
- **Stacks multiplicatively**: Combines with other power/accuracy modifiers

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability PlasmaLamp = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            if (moveType == TYPE_FIRE || moveType == TYPE_ELECTRIC) MUL(1.2);
        },
    .onAccuracy = +[](ON_ACCURACY) -> AccuracyPriority {
        CHECK(moveType == TYPE_FIRE || moveType == TYPE_ELECTRIC)
        *accuracy *= 1.2;
        return ACCURACY_MULTIPLICATIVE;
    },
};
```

### Power Boost Mechanics
- **Multiplier**: 1.2x (20% increase) to base power
- **Calculation**: Applied during damage calculation phase
- **Stacking**: Multiplicative with other power boosts (STAB, items, etc.)
- **Affected moves**: All Fire and Electric moves, including:
  - Physical moves (Flare Blitz, Wild Charge)
  - Special moves (Flamethrower, Thunderbolt)
  - Status moves that deal damage (Thunder Wave doesn't get power boost)

### Accuracy Boost Mechanics
- **Multiplier**: 1.2x (20% increase) to base accuracy
- **Calculation**: Applied during accuracy check phase
- **Priority**: ACCURACY_MULTIPLICATIVE (standard timing)
- **Affected moves**: All Fire and Electric moves, including status moves
- **Examples**:
  - Thunder (70% accuracy to 84% accuracy)
  - Fire Blast (85% accuracy to 102% accuracy, capped at 100%)
  - Will-O-Wisp (85% accuracy to 102% accuracy, capped at 100%)

### Move Type Coverage
**Fire-type moves affected:**
- Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Overheat, Heat Wave
- Flare Blitz, Fire Punch, Flame Wheel
- Will-O-Wisp, Sunny Day (accuracy only)
- Sacred Fire, Blue Flare, V-create

**Electric-type moves affected:**
- Thunderbolt, Thunder, Discharge, Volt Switch
- Wild Charge, Thunder Punch, Spark
- Thunder Wave, Thunder Shock
- Zap Cannon, Bolt Strike, Fusion Bolt

### Strategic Implications
- **Mixed attacker synergy**: Benefits both physical and special Fire/Electric moves
- **Reliability boost**: Makes less accurate moves more consistent
- **Coverage enhancement**: Improves two common offensive types
- **No drawbacks**: Pure beneficial effect with no negative trade-offs
- **Type specialization**: Rewards mono-type or dual-type offensive sets

### Competitive Usage
- **Ideal users**: Pokemon with strong Fire/Electric movesets
- **Mixed sets**: Pokemon that run both physical and special Fire/Electric moves
- **Accuracy-dependent moves**: Makes Thunder and Fire Blast more reliable
- **STAB synergy**: Combines excellently with Fire/Electric dual-types
- **Choice item synergy**: Boosts locked-in Fire/Electric moves

### Damage Calculations
With STAB and Plasma Lamp on a Fire-type:
- Base move power x 1.5 (STAB) x 1.2 (Plasma Lamp) = 1.8x total multiplier
- Example: Flamethrower (90 BP) to 90 x 1.8 = 162 effective base power

### Accuracy Calculations
Examples of accuracy improvements:
- Thunder: 70% to 84%
- Fire Blast: 85% to 100% (capped)
- Zap Cannon: 50% to 60%
- Will-O-Wisp: 85% to 100% (capped)

### Synergistic Abilities
- **Flash Fire**: Absorb Fire moves to boost power further
- **Motor Drive/Volt Absorb**: Immunity to Electric moves for switching
- **Solar Power**: Additional Fire move boost in sun
- **Dry Skin**: Takes damage from Fire moves but ability still works

### Item Synergies
- **Choice items**: Boost locked-in Fire/Electric moves
- **Life Orb**: Stacks multiplicatively with Plasma Lamp
- **Expert Belt**: Super effective Fire/Electric moves get both boosts
- **Magnet/Charcoal**: Type-boosting items stack with ability
- **Wide Lens**: Additional accuracy boost for ultra-reliable moves

### Counters and Limitations
- **Type limitation**: Only affects two types, leaving other moves unboostered
- **Flash Fire**: Opponents can absorb Fire moves for their own boost
- **Ground immunity**: Electric moves don't affect Ground-types regardless
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas disable the ability
- **Type-changing moves**: Moves that change type lose the boost

### Common Pokemon Synergies
**Ideal candidates:**
- Fire/Electric dual-types (Rotom-Heat forms)
- Mixed attackers with both Fire and Electric moves
- Pokemon with diverse Fire/Electric movesets
- Bulky attackers that benefit from accuracy boosts

**Move combinations:**
- Flamethrower + Thunderbolt (special mixed)
- Fire Punch + Thunder Punch (physical mixed)
- Overheat + Volt Switch (momentum + power)
- Will-O-Wisp + Thunder Wave (status utility)

### Version History
- Elite Redux custom ability (ID 466)
- Designed for Fire/Electric type specialization
- Part of the expanded ability roster for diverse team building
- Provides simple but effective dual-type offensive boost
