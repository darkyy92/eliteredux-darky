# Calculative - Ability ID 793

## In-Game Description
"Analytic + Neuroforce."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Calculative combines Analytic and Neuroforce. Analytic boosts damage by 30% when moving after the target. Neuroforce increases super-effective moves by 35%. Together they reward calculated plays and exploiting type matchups. Ideal for slow, strategic Pokemon who excel at precise timing.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Calculative is a compound ability that combines the effects of both Analytic and Neuroforce, creating a powerful offensive ability perfect for slow, strategic Pokémon. Both components activate independently during the same attack calculation.

### Component Abilities

#### Analytic Component
- **Damage boost**: 30% (1.3x multiplier) to offensive moves
- **Activation condition**: Only when the user moves after the target in the same turn
- **Turn order dependency**: Requires slower speed or lower priority
- **Excluded moves**: Future Sight and Doom Desire are not boosted

#### Neuroforce Component  
- **Damage boost**: 35% (1.35x multiplier) to offensive moves
- **Activation condition**: Only on super-effective attacks (2x effectiveness or higher)
- **Effectiveness requirement**: Must have type effectiveness ≥ 2.0x
- **Stacks multiplicatively**: Works with other damage multipliers

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability Calculative = {
    .onOffensiveMultiplier =
        +[](ON_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER) {
            Analytic.onOffensiveMultiplier(DELEGATE_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER);
            Neuroforce.onOffensiveMultiplier(DELEGATE_OFFENSIVE_MULTIPLIER);
        },
};

// Analytic: 30% boost when moving after target
if (GetBattlerTurnOrderNum(target) < gCurrentTurnActionNumber && 
    gBattleMoves[move].effect != EFFECT_FUTURE_SIGHT) MUL(1.3);

// Neuroforce: 35% boost on super-effective moves  
if (typeEffectivenessMultiplier >= UQ_4_12(2.0)) MUL(1.35);
```

### Damage Calculations

#### Individual Component Examples
- **Analytic only**: 100 base power → 130 power (when moving second)
- **Neuroforce only**: 100 base power → 135 power (on super-effective hit)

#### Combined Effect Examples
When both components activate (moving second with super-effective move):
- **Base calculation**: 100 base power
- **With Analytic**: 100 × 1.3 = 130 power  
- **With Neuroforce**: 130 × 1.35 = 175.5 power
- **Total multiplier**: 1.755x damage boost

### Activation Scenarios

#### Maximum Effectiveness
Calculative reaches its full potential when:
1. **Speed disadvantage**: User moves after the target
2. **Type advantage**: Attack is super-effective (2x+ effectiveness)
3. **Combined result**: 75.5% damage increase

#### Partial Activation
- **Analytic only**: Moving second against neutral/resisted moves (+30%)
- **Neuroforce only**: Moving first with super-effective moves (+35%)
- **No activation**: Moving first with neutral/resisted moves (no boost)

### Strategic Applications

#### Ideal Users
- **Slow powerhouses**: Pokémon with high Attack/Special Attack but low Speed
- **Tank builds**: Bulky attackers who can afford to move second
- **Coverage specialists**: Pokémon with diverse movesets for type advantages
- **Trick Room sweepers**: Excel in reversed speed priority environments

#### Team Synergies
- **Trick Room teams**: Speed inversion maximizes Analytic activation
- **Thunder Wave support**: Paralysis helps ensure moving second
- **Choice Scarf counters**: Powerful revenge killing potential
- **Entry hazard teams**: Weakened opponents easier to finish with boosted moves

#### Move Selection Priorities
1. **Super-effective coverage moves**: Maximize Neuroforce activation
2. **High base power attacks**: Maximize damage from multipliers  
3. **Reliable accuracy**: Avoid missing critical revenge kills
4. **Priority moves**: Sometimes worth sacrificing Analytic for guaranteed hits

### Common Users
- **Beheeyem**: Primary user with Calculative as an innate ability
- **Slow special attackers**: Benefit from calculated timing
- **Mixed attackers**: Can exploit both physical and special type matchups
- **Bulky offensive Pokémon**: Can survive to move second consistently

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Revenge killing**: Excellent for eliminating weakened threats
- **Late-game sweeping**: Devastating when speed control is established  
- **Coverage exploitation**: Rewards diverse movesets and type knowledge
- **Speed tier management**: Sometimes beneficial to avoid speed ties
- **Choice item synergy**: Locked moves work well with prediction-based play

### Counters and Limitations

#### Direct Counters
- **Priority moves**: Bypass speed-based Analytic activation
- **Speed control**: Thunder Wave, Sticky Web, Tailwind negate speed disadvantage
- **Resistant typing**: Reduces super-effective opportunities
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas disable both components

#### Strategic Limitations
- **Speed dependency**: Less effective on naturally fast Pokémon
- **Type coverage reliance**: Requires diverse moveset for consistent Neuroforce
- **Prediction intensive**: Optimal use requires accurate opponent prediction
- **Setup vulnerability**: Slow Pokémon can be set up on easily

### Synergistic Abilities and Items
- **Life Orb**: Stacks multiplicatively with both damage boosts
- **Choice items**: Lock-in works well with prediction-based gameplay
- **Expert Belt**: Additional super-effective damage stacking
- **Iron Ball/Lagging Tail**: Ensure moving second for Analytic
- **Room Service**: Speed reduction in Trick Room for consistent activation

### Version History and Notes
- **Elite Redux original**: Compound ability combining two established effects
- **Design philosophy**: Rewards strategic thinking and type knowledge
- **Balance consideration**: High skill ceiling with situational activation
- **Competitive viability**: Strong in prediction-heavy metagames
- **Future Sight exclusion**: Maintains Analytic's traditional limitations
