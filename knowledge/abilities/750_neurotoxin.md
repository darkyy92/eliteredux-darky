# Neurotoxin - Ability ID 750

## In-Game Description
"Inflicting poison also lowers Attack, SpAtk, and Speed."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

When this Pokemon poisons an opponent, the toxic effects also weaken their offensive capabilities and mobility. Each poisoned foe has their Attack, Special Attack, and Speed lowered by one stage immediately upon being poisoned.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Neurotoxin is a reactive ability that triggers additional stat debuffs whenever the user successfully poisons an opponent. It's built on the "PoisonPuppeteer" framework, which tracks poison infliction and applies secondary effects.

### Core Mechanics
- **Trigger Condition**: When the user inflicts poison on any opponent
- **Primary Effect**: Lowers target's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed by 1 stage each
- **Activation Timing**: Immediately after poison is successfully applied
- **Multi-target Support**: Affects all targets that get poisoned in the same turn

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
static int NeurotoxinCondition(int battler, int target) {
    return CanLowerStat(target, STAT_ATK) || CanLowerStat(target, STAT_SPATK) || CanLowerStat(target, STAT_SPEED);
}

constexpr Ability Neurotoxin = {
    .onReactive = +[](ON_REACTIVE) -> int { return PoisonPuppeteerClone(ability, battler, NeurotoxinCondition, BattleScript_Neurotoxin); },
    .onBattlerFaints = PoisonPuppeteer.onBattlerFaints,
    .onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_OTHER,
    .setStateOnEffect = MOVE_EFFECT_POISON,
};
```

### Activation Requirements
- The user must successfully inflict poison (regular poison or badly poisoned)
- Target must not be immune to stat reduction
- At least one of the three stats (Attack, Sp. Attack, Speed) must be lowerable

### Battle Script Effects
The battle script `BattleScript_Neurotoxin` performs the following sequence:
1. Attempts to lower Attack by 1 stage
2. Attempts to lower Special Attack by 1 stage  
3. Attempts to lower Speed by 1 stage
4. Shows appropriate messages for each successful/failed stat change
5. Plays stat decrease animation for all affected stats simultaneously

### Affected Moves and Methods
Neurotoxin triggers from any source of poison infliction:
- **Direct Poison Moves**: Poison Gas, Poison Powder, Toxic, etc.
- **Secondary Effect Moves**: Sludge Bomb, Poison Jab, Sludge Wave (30% poison chance)
- **Status-Inflicting Moves**: Poison Sting, Twineedle
- **Ability-Based Poison**: Poison Point, Effect Spore (if user has Neurotoxin)
- **Item-Based Poison**: Toxic Orb (when passed to opponent)

### Interactions with Other Mechanics

**Stat Reduction Immunities**:
- Clear Body, White Smoke, Full Metal Body prevent all stat drops
- Hyper Cutter prevents Attack reduction specifically
- Keen Eye prevents accuracy reduction (not relevant here)

**Competitive Interactions**:
- **Substitute**: Cannot lower stats of a Pokemon behind Substitute
- **Mist**: Prevents stat reduction while active
- **Sacred Sword/Chip Away**: Ignores stat changes but doesn't prevent them
- **Contrary**: Would boost stats instead of lowering them

### Strategic Applications

**Offensive Strategy**:
- Pairs excellently with multi-hit poison moves like Poison Jab
- Synergizes with Toxic Spikes for entry hazard control
- Works well with poison-spreading abilities and moves

**Defensive Strategy**:
- Weakens physical and special attackers simultaneously
- Speed reduction helps with revenge kills and priority moves
- Creates momentum through stat pressure

### Common Users
- **Mega Arbok**: Poison/Dark type with strong offensive presence
- **Gliscor (Redux Form)**: Poison/Fire variant with enhanced offensive capabilities

### Competitive Viability

**Strengths**:
- Immediate impact beyond just poison damage
- Multi-stat debuff creates significant swing turns
- Stacks with other stat-reducing effects
- Works on both physical and special attackers

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires successful poison infliction to activate
- Blocked by stat immunity abilities
- Single-use per target (poison immunity after first application)
- Many Pokemon carry Pecha Berry or similar items

### Counters and Responses
- **Poison Immunity**: Poison, Steel types naturally immune
- **Immunity Abilities**: Immunity, Poison Heal, Water Veil (burns only)
- **Restoration**: Aromatherapy, Heal Bell remove poison and stop future triggers
- **Stat Immunity**: Clear Body, White Smoke, etc. prevent debuffs
- **Cleric Support**: Teammates with status removal moves

### Synergistic Abilities and Moves
- **Merciless**: Extra damage against poisoned targets
- **Hex**: Double damage against status-afflicted targets  
- **Venoshock**: Double damage against poisoned targets
- **Toxic Spikes**: Automatic poison on switch-in
- **Corrosion**: Allows poisoning of Steel and Poison types

### Version History
- Introduced in Elite Redux as part of the expanded ability system
- Built on the PoisonPuppeteer framework for consistent poison-trigger mechanics
- Designed to give poison-type specialists more battlefield control options
