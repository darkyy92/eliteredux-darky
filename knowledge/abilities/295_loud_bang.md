# Loud Bang - Ability ID 295

## In-Game Description
"Sound-based moves have 50% chance to confuse the foe."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Sound-based moves have a 50% chance to confuse the target upon successful hit. This includes all moves with the sound flag like Growl, Roar, Sing, Supersonic, Screech, and Hyper Voice. The confusion effect only triggers when the move connects and affects the target.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Loud Bang is an offensive ability that activates when the user successfully hits an opponent with a sound-based move, providing a 50% chance to inflict confusion on the target.

### Activation Conditions
The ability triggers when ALL of the following conditions are met:
1. The Pokemon with Loud Bang uses a sound-based move
2. The move successfully hits the opponent
3. The target is not immune to confusion effects
4. A 50% random chance check passes (`Random() % 2`)

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability LoudBang = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(target))
        CHECK(CanBeConfused(target))
        CHECK(IsSoundMove(battler, move))
        CHECK(Random() % 2)

        return AbilityStatusEffect(MOVE_EFFECT_CONFUSION);
    },
};
```

### Sound Move Detection
A move is considered a sound move if:
- It has the `FLAG_SOUND` flag in its move data, OR
- It's a Normal-type move and the user has the Reverberate ability

### Complete List of Affected Moves
Common sound moves that trigger Loud Bang include:
- **Growl** - Lowers Attack, Special attack with 60 power
- **Roar** - Forces target to switch out
- **Sing** - Puts target to sleep
- **Supersonic** - Confuses target

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Soundproof**: Pokemon with Soundproof are immune to sound moves, so Loud Bang cannot affect them
- **Own Tempo**: Pokemon with Own Tempo cannot be confused, blocking Loud Bang's effect
- **Mental Herb**: Cures confusion immediately, negating the effect
- **Substitute**: Sound moves bypass Substitute, so Loud Bang can still trigger
- **Throat Chop**: If the user is affected by Throat Chop, they cannot use sound moves for 2 turns
- **Multi-hit moves**: Each hit has a separate 50% chance to confuse if it's a sound move

### Strategic Implications
- **Offensive Utility**: Provides additional disruption potential to sound-based attackers
- **Move Selection**: Encourages use of sound moves even if they're not the most powerful option
- **Team Building**: Pairs well with Pokemon that learn multiple sound moves
- **Disruption Factor**: Can turn utility moves like Growl into potential confusion setters

### Example Damage Calculations
Loud Bang itself doesn't affect damage calculations, but the confusion it causes can:
- Confused Pokemon have a 33% chance to hurt themselves instead of attacking
- Self-damage from confusion is calculated as a 40 power typeless physical attack against the user's own Defense stat

### Common Users
In Elite Redux, Loud Bang is typically found on:
- Sound-themed Pokemon (Exploud line, Chatot, etc.)
- Pokemon with strong sound move coverage
- Support Pokemon that use sound-based utility moves

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Disruption Tool**: Excellent for disrupting opposing sweepers and setup Pokemon
- **Utility Enhancement**: Makes normally weak sound moves like Growl potentially game-changing
- **Stacking Effects**: Can combine with other confusion-inducing moves for consistent disruption
- **Counter-Setup**: Particularly effective against Pokemon trying to set up with stat-boosting moves

### Counters
- **Soundproof**: Complete immunity to sound moves prevents activation
- **Own Tempo**: Immunity to confusion effects
- **Mental Herb/Persim Berry**: Immediate confusion cure
- **Substitute**: While sound moves bypass Substitute, some strategies can still work around it
- **Taunt**: Prevents use of status sound moves

### Synergies
- **Throat Spray**: Boosts Special Attack when using sound moves, creating offensive pressure
- **Amplifier/Bass Boosted**: Other abilities that enhance sound moves
- **Choice items**: Lock into powerful sound moves for consistent confusion chances
- **Wide Lens**: Increases accuracy of sound moves to ensure they connect

### Version History
