## Basic Information
- **Ability ID**: 391
- **Name**: Hardened Sheath
- **Original Description**: "Ups Attack by +1 when using horn moves."
- **Type**: Offensive Enhancement
- **Activation**: On-hit after using horn-based moves

## Technical Implementation

### Code Location
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
- **Lines**: 4035-4045
- **Function**: `HardenedSheath`

### Implementation Details
```cpp
constexpr Ability HardenedSheath = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].hornBased)
        CHECK(ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, STAT_ATK, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER, NULL))

        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_AttackBoostActivates);
        gBattleScripting.battler = battler;
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Trigger Conditions
1. **ShouldApplyOnHitAffect**: Confirms the move successfully hit the target
2. **gBattleMoves[move].hornBased**: Verifies the move has the `hornBased` flag set to TRUE
3. **ChangeStatBuffs**: Attempts to raise Attack by +1 stage (fails if already at +6)

## Strategic Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Snowball Potential**: Each successful horn move increases Attack, creating powerful momentum
2. **Move Variety**: Works with both physical and special horn-based moves
3. **Stacking Effect**: Can reach +6 Attack with repeated use
4. **No Drawbacks**: Pure offensive boost with no negative side effects

### Weaknesses
1. **Move Dependency**: Only works with horn-based moves, limiting moveset flexibility
2. **Hit Dependency**: Requires moves to successfully hit to activate
3. **Limited Move Pool**: Not all Pokemon with this ability may have access to multiple horn moves
4. **Accuracy Issues**: Some horn moves have lower accuracy, making consistent activation challenging

### Competitive Applications

## Competitive Viability

### Tier Assessment: Medium
- **Pros**: Reliable setup mechanism, good move variety, no activation cost
- **Cons**: Move restriction, hit dependency, gradual setup required
- **Best Use Cases**: Bulky setup sweepers, late-game cleaners, Baton Pass teams

### Format Considerations
- **Single Battles**: Good for setup sweepers and late-game threats
- **Double Battles**: More challenging due to target selection and faster pace
- **Battle Facilities**: Excellent for long battles where setup is viable

## Conclusion

Hardened Sheath represents a solid offensive enhancement ability that rewards consistent use of horn-based moves. While it requires specific move selection and successful hits to activate, the ability to stack Attack boosts makes it a threatening late-game tool. The variety of horn-based moves available provides some flexibility in team building, though users must balance offensive potential with the need for reliable hit rates.

The ability shines best on bulky Pokemon that can survive long enough to accumulate multiple boosts, or on fast Pokemon that can quickly capitalize on early boosts. Its medium competitive tier reflects its usefulness without being overwhelming, making it a strategic choice for players who enjoy setup-based playstyles.
