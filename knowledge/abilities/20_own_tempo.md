# Own Tempo - Ability ID 20

## In-Game Description
"Immune to confusion, Intimidate and Scare."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Own Tempo maintains perfect composure, granting immunity to confusion from all sources. Also blocks Intimidate's Attack drop and prevents the custom Scared status effect. Works against Swagger, Teeter Dance, and all confusion-inducing moves. Elite Redux expanded immunities beyond confusion.

*Character count: 291*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Own Tempo provides triple immunity through various battle script checks and ability flags:

### 1. Confusion Immunity

Handled through the `checktargetowntempoprotects` battle script macro:
- Groups Own Tempo with Discipline, Rock Head, and Steel Barrel
- Prevents confusion from ALL sources
- Displays ability pop-up and message when triggered

**Blocked Confusion Sources**:
- **Moves**: Confuse Ray, Supersonic, Sweet Kiss, Teeter Dance
- **Secondary Effects**: Confusion from Water Pulse, Psybeam, etc.
- **Swagger**: Blocks confusion but attack boost still applies
- **Attract**: Listed in some battle scripts suggesting possible interaction
- **Self-Inflicted**: Prevents Outrage/Petal Dance confusion

**Battle Message**: "Pokémon prevents confusion with [Own Tempo]!"

### 2. Intimidate Immunity

According to the ability description, Own Tempo blocks Intimidate:
- Prevents Attack reduction when opponent switches in with Intimidate
- Part of Elite Redux's expanded Own Tempo functionality
- Maintains offensive pressure against Intimidate users

### 3. Scared Status Immunity

Protects against the custom "Scared" status effect:
- Scared is tracked via `RESOURCE_FLAG_SCARED` in battle resources
- Appears to be a custom Elite Redux status condition
- Found in battle structure as `scaredMon`
- Own Tempo users cannot be inflicted with this status

### Ability Properties
- **AI Rating**: 3 (moderate value)
- Works both defensively and preemptively
- Cannot be temporarily suppressed during battle

### Strategic Implications

**Offensive Benefits**:
- Maintains setup against Intimidate leads
- Can use Swagger on allies safely (if doubles)
- No Outrage/Petal Dance drawback

**Defensive Benefits**:
- Immune to confusion disruption strategies
- Counters Swagger + Thunder Wave combos
- Reliable against RNG confusion

**Unique Elite Redux Features**:
- Scared status immunity (custom mechanic)
- Intimidate blocking (expanded from originals)

### Technical Implementation
- Confusion immunity via battle script macros
- Multiple script checks for different confusion sources
- Grouped with other confusion-preventing abilities
- Custom status immunities added for Elite Redux

### Pokémon with Own Tempo
Many Pokémon have access to Own Tempo as a changeable ability option in Elite Redux, significantly more than in the original games.

### Competitive Usage Notes

**Team Roles**:
- Setup sweepers that use Outrage/Petal Dance
- Physical attackers countering Intimidate
- Defensive pivots immune to disruption

**Key Advantages**:
- Enables safe Outrage/Thrash spam
- Counters confusion + paralysis strategies  
- Maintains momentum against Intimidate

**Limitations**:
- No direct offensive boost
- Other status conditions work normally
- Doesn't prevent other stat drops

### Interactions

1. **With Swagger**:
   - Receives Attack boost
   - Immune to confusion
   - Can benefit from ally Swagger in doubles

2. **With Intimidate**:
   - Completely blocks Attack reduction
   - Maintains offensive pressure

3. **With Multi-Turn Moves**:
   - Outrage/Petal Dance/Thrash have no drawback
   - Can be used consecutively without risk

### Counters
- Direct status moves (paralysis, burn, sleep)
- Stat reduction moves besides Intimidate
- Raw offensive pressure
- Ability suppression

### Synergies
- Outrage users gain consistent damage
- Physical attackers bypass Intimidate
- Teams that struggle with confusion
- Pairs well with other status immunities

### Version History
Elite Redux significantly expanded Own Tempo:
- **Original**: Only prevented confusion
- **Elite Redux**: Added Intimidate and Scared immunity

This makes Own Tempo a versatile ability providing multiple forms of disruption immunity, particularly valuable in Elite Redux's expanded status effect environment.
