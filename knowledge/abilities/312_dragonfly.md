# Dragonfly - Ability ID 312

## In-Game Description
"Adds Dragon type to itself. Avoids Ground attacks."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Dragonfly grants the Dragon type to the Pokemon on switch-in, creating dual or triple typing. The ability also provides complete immunity to Ground-type moves through levitation, making the Pokemon unaffected by moves like Earthquake and Spikes.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Dragonfly is a dual-function ability that combines type addition with Ground immunity:

1. **Type Addition**: On entry, adds Dragon type to the Pokemon using the same mechanism as Half Drake ability
2. **Levitation**: Provides complete immunity to Ground-type moves and hazards

### Activation Conditions
- **Type Addition**: Triggers automatically upon switching into battle
- **Ground Immunity**: Passive effect active at all times while the ability is not suppressed

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Dragonfly = {
    .onEntry = HalfDrake.onEntry,  // Adds Dragon type
    .breakable = TRUE,             // Can be suppressed
    .levitate = TRUE,              // Ground immunity
};

// Type addition implementation (from HalfDrake)
.onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int { 
    return AddBattlerType(battler, TYPE_DRAGON); 
}
```

### Ground-Type Immunity Coverage
- **Moves**: All Ground-type attacks (Earthquake, Earth Power, Bulldoze, etc.)
- **Entry hazards**: Spikes damage
- **Arena effects**: Arena Trap cannot trap levitating Pokemon
- **Interactions**: Overridden by Gravity, Iron Ball, and Ingrain effects

### Type Addition Mechanics
- Adds Dragon type as an additional type (does not replace existing types)
- Creates dual typing for single-type Pokemon
- Creates triple typing for dual-type Pokemon (rare mechanic)
- Dragon typing persists until the Pokemon switches out or the ability is suppressed

### Strategic Implications
**Offensive Benefits:**
- Gains access to Dragon-type STAB on Dragon moves
- May create powerful type combinations (e.g., Ground/Bug/Dragon for Flygon line)

**Defensive Benefits:**
- Complete Ground immunity removes major weakness
- Dragon typing provides useful resistances (Fire, Water, Electric, Grass)

**Potential Drawbacks:**
- Dragon typing adds weakness to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy moves
- Ability can be suppressed by Mold Breaker effects
- Triple typing can create complex type interactions

### Common Users
- **Vibrava**: Ground/Bug to Ground/Bug/Dragon with Ground immunity
- **Flygon**: Ground/Dragon to Already Dragon type, gains Ground immunity

### Competitive Usage Notes
- Excellent for pivoting against Ground-type attacks
- Transforms Flygon into a unique Ground/Dragon that's immune to Ground moves
- Creates type synergy opportunities in team building
- Particularly valuable against Earthquake spam teams

### Counters
- **Ability Suppression**: Mold Breaker, Teravolt, Turboblaze ignore the Ground immunity
- **Status Effects**: Gravity grounds the Pokemon, removing Ground immunity
- **Items**: Iron Ball grounds the holder
- **Moves**: Ingrain removes levitation effect
- **Type Disadvantages**: Ice, Dragon, and Fairy moves become super effective

### Synergies
- **Flying-type moves**: Standard Levitate provides 1.25x boost to Flying moves
- **Ground-type moves**: Can use Ground moves while being immune to them
- **Dragon-type moves**: Gains STAB on Dragon moves
- **Magnet Rise**: Stacks with natural levitation for extended Ground immunity

### Version History
- Added as part of Elite Redux's expanded ability system
- Combines mechanics from Half Drake (type addition) and standard Levitate
- Unique implementation using shared ability components
