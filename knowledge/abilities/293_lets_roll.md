# Let's Roll - Ability ID 293

## In-Game Description
"Casts Defense Curl on entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Let's Roll automatically raises Defense by one stage and applies the Defense Curl status upon entering battle. The Defense Curl effect doubles the power of Rollout and Ice Ball moves. This provides immediate bulk and enables powerful rolling move strategies for defensive Pokemon builds.

*Character count: 287*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Let's Roll is an entry ability that combines two distinct effects:
1. **Defense Boost**: Raises the user's Defense stat by one stage (+50% physical defense)
2. **Defense Curl Status**: Applies the STATUS2_DEFENSE_CURL flag to the Pokemon

### Activation Conditions
- Triggers automatically when the Pokemon enters battle (switching in, sent out at start of battle)
- Only activates if the Defense stat can be raised (not blocked by Clear Body, etc.)
- Does not activate if already at maximum Defense stages (+6)

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability LetsRoll = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_DEF))

        SetStatChanger(STAT_DEF, 1);
        gBattleMons[battler].status2 = STATUS2_DEFENSE_CURL;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_BattlerInnateStatRaiseOnSwitchIn);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Defense Curl Status Effects
The Defense Curl status provides:
- **Rollout Power Boost**: Doubles the base power of Rollout (30 → 60 BP for first hit)
- **Ice Ball Power Boost**: Doubles the base power of Ice Ball (30 → 60 BP for first hit)
- **Move Synergy**: These moves continue to increase power each consecutive turn when used

### Affected Moves
- **Rollout**: Base power increased from 30 to 60 on first use, then continues doubling each turn
- **Ice Ball**: Base power increased from 30 to 60 on first use, then continues doubling each turn

### Interactions with Other Mechanics
- **Stat Boost Blocking**: Abilities like Clear Body, White Smoke prevent the Defense boost but not the Defense Curl status
- **Stat Reset**: Haze, Clear Smog remove Defense boost but Defense Curl status remains
- **Baton Pass**: Defense boost can be passed, Defense Curl status cannot
- **Rollout Counter**: Defense Curl status increases Rollout's rollout counter by 1 initially

### Strategic Implications
**Immediate Value:**
- Provides instant physical bulk (+50% defense against physical attacks)
- Enables immediate use of powered-up rolling moves
- Great for pivot Pokemon that need to tank a hit on entry

**Rolling Move Strategy:**
- Makes Rollout/Ice Ball viable as primary attacking options
- First hit deals doubled damage (60 BP instead of 30)
- Subsequent hits follow normal doubling pattern (120, 240, 480, 960 BP)
- Creates powerful late-game sweeping potential

### Example Damage Calculations
**Rollout with Defense Curl (Level 50, 100 Attack, neutral nature):**
- Turn 1: 60 BP (doubled from 30)
- Turn 2: 120 BP 
- Turn 3: 240 BP
- Turn 4: 480 BP
- Turn 5: 960 BP

**Without Defense Curl:**
- Turn 1: 30 BP
- Turn 2: 60 BP
- Turn 3: 120 BP
- Turn 4: 240 BP
- Turn 5: 480 BP

### Common Users
Notable Pokemon with Let's Roll include:
- **Sandslash**: Physical tank with Rollout access
- **Mamoswine**: Bulky physical attacker with Ice Ball
- **Shuckle**: Extreme defensive utility
- **Golem**: Rock-type physical tank
- **Forretress**: Steel-type defensive pivot
- **Snorlax**: Physical wall with potential offense

### Competitive Usage Notes
**Strengths:**
- Immediate defensive presence upon entry
- Enables unique rolling move strategies
- Works well on defensive pivots
- No setup required - activates automatically

**Weaknesses:**
- Defense boost can be removed by stat-clearing moves
- Rolling moves lock the user into the attack
- Vulnerable to Ghost-types (Rollout/Ice Ball can't hit)
- Single-use activation per battle entry

### Counters
- **Stat Control**: Haze, Clear Smog remove Defense boost
- **Ghost Types**: Immune to Rollout/Ice Ball followup
- **Special Attackers**: Defense boost doesn't help against special moves
- **Status Moves**: Taunt prevents potential setup after entry
- **Forcing Switches**: Roar, Whirlwind reset rolling move chains

### Synergies
**Defensive Synergies:**
- **Leftovers**: Sustain after tanking hits
- **Rocky Helmet**: Punish contact moves while boosted
- **Stamina**: Stack Defense boosts from taking damage

**Offensive Synergies:**
- **Choice Band**: Massive power boost to rolling moves
- **Life Orb**: Additional damage boost
- **Metronome**: Stacks with rolling move power increases

### Version History
- Introduced in Elite Redux as a unique defensive/offensive hybrid ability
- Designed to make rolling moves more viable in competitive play
- Part of the expanded ability system providing more strategic options
