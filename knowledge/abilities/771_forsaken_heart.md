# Forsaken Heart - Ability ID 771

## In-Game Description
"KOs dealt anywhere on the field raise Attack by one stage."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Whenever any Pokemon faints on the battlefield, this Pokemon's Attack rises by one stage. Unlike abilities such as Moxie that only activate when the user defeats an opponent, Forsaken Heart triggers from any KO that occurs during battle, including ally defeats.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**Trigger Condition**: Any Pokemon fainting on the battlefield (`.onBattlerFaintsFor = APPLY_ON_ANY`)

**Effect**: Raises the user's Attack stat by one stage using `ChangeStatBuffs(battler, 1, STAT_ATK, MOVE_EFFECT_AFFECTS_USER | STAT_BUFF_DONT_SET_BUFFERS, NULL)`

**Key Differences from Similar Abilities**:
- **Moxie**: Only triggers when the user defeats an opponent (APPLY_ON_ATTACKER)
- **Soul Heart**: Same trigger condition but raises Special Attack instead of Attack
- **Forsaken Heart**: Triggers on ANY faint, making it more versatile in doubles/triples

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses the `onBattlerFaints` callback with `APPLY_ON_ANY` scope
- Calls `BattleScript_RaiseStatOnFaintingTarget` for the stat boost animation
- The `STAT_BUFF_DONT_SET_BUFFERS` flag prevents setting battle buffers during the stat change
- Can potentially activate multiple times per turn in multi-battles

**Strategic Applications**:
- Extremely powerful in doubles/triples where multiple KOs can occur
- Benefits from team strategies that result in frequent fainting
- Can turn disadvantageous situations (ally defeats) into stat boosts
- Particularly effective on bulky attackers who can survive to accumulate multiple boosts

**Battle Script Flow**:
1. Any Pokemon faints
2. Check if user has Forsaken Heart
3. Attempt to raise Attack by 1 stage
4. Display ability activation message and stat boost animation
5. Continue with battle flow

This ability represents a dark, opportunistic fighting style where the user grows stronger from witnessing death on the battlefield, regardless of whether it's friend or foe.
