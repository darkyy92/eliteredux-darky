Hospitality + Soothing Aroma effects.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

On switch-in, Butter Up heals allies for 25% of their max HP (Hospitality) and cures all status conditions for the entire party (Soothing Aroma). Both effects trigger simultaneously upon entering battle. Invaluable support ability for doubles, providing instant healing and cleansing.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Butter Up is a combination ability that merges the effects of both Hospitality and Soothing Aroma. When the Pokemon enters battle, it simultaneously heals its ally for 25% of their maximum HP and cures all status ailments across the entire party. This makes Butter Up incredibly valuable in double battles, providing immediate team support through both healing and status cleansing in a single activation.
