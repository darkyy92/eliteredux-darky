# Butter Up

Butter Up is a combination ability that merges the effects of both Hospitality and Soothing Aroma. When the Pokemon enters battle, it simultaneously heals its ally for 25% of their maximum HP and cures all status ailments across the entire party. This makes Butter Up incredibly valuable in double battles, providing immediate team support through both healing and status cleansing in a single activation.
