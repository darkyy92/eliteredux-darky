# Embody Aspect (Cornerstone) - Ability ID 797

## In-Game Description
"+1 Defense on Entry."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Embody Aspect (Cornerstone) raises the Pokemon's Defense by one stage immediately upon switching into battle. This defensive boost occurs regardless of how the Pokemon enters battle, whether through normal switching, forced switching, or other entry methods.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
- **Primary Effect**: Raises Defense by +1 stage upon entry
- **Timing**: Activates immediately when the Pokemon switches into battle
- **Implementation**: Uses the same code as Dauntless Shield (`DauntlessShield.onEntry`)

### Activation Conditions
- Triggers when the Pokemon switches into battle through any means:
  - Normal switching
  - Forced switching (e.g., from Roar, Whirlwind)
  - Entry after fainting of previous Pokemon
  - Entry from moves like U-turn, Volt Switch

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability EmbodyAspectCornerstone = {
    .onEntry = DauntlessShield.onEntry,
};

// DauntlessShield implementation:
constexpr Ability DauntlessShield = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_DEF))
        
        SetStatChanger(STAT_DEF, 1);
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_BattlerAbilityStatRaiseOnSwitchIn);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Numerical Values
- **Stat Boost**: +1 stage to Defense (increases Defense by 50%)
- **Maximum Applications**: Can only boost Defense if it's not already at maximum (+6 stages)

### Interactions with Other Abilities/Mechanics
- **Blocked by**: Clear Body, White Smoke, Full Metal Body prevent the stat boost
- **Overwritten by**: Abilities like Simple double the stat boost to +2 Defense
- **Stacks with**: Other Defense-boosting abilities and moves
- **Fails if**: Defense is already at maximum (+6 stages)

### Strategic Implications
- **Defensive Setup**: Provides immediate bulk upon switching in
- **Pivot Potential**: Makes switching safer by gaining defensive presence
- **Synergy**: Works well with defensive movesets and stall strategies
- **Counterplay**: Can be reset by stat-resetting moves like Haze, Clear Smog

### Common Users
- **Ogerpon (Cornerstone Mask Mega)**: The primary user of this ability
  - Type: Grass/Rock
  - Base Defense: 156 (after Mega Evolution)
  - Complements its defensive role with immediate Defense boost

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Format Viability**: Strong in defensive teams and balance cores
- **Entry Hazard Synergy**: Helps offset damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes
- **Momentum Control**: Allows safer switching and defensive plays
- **Multi-Battle Value**: Activates every time the Pokemon switches in

### Counters
- **Stat Reset**: Haze, Clear Smog remove the Defense boost
- **Bypassing**: Critical hits ignore the Defense boost
- **Special Attacks**: Only boosts physical Defense, not Special Defense
- **Stat Prevention**: Clear Body variants prevent the boost entirely

### Synergies
- **Assault Vest**: Complements special bulk with physical bulk
- **Rocky Helmet**: Enhanced damage reflection with higher Defense
- **Leftovers**: Sustainable recovery for defensive roles
- **Protective Moves**: Works well with Protect, Substitute strategies

### Version History
- **Elite Redux**: Part of the Embody Aspect ability series for Ogerpon forms
- **Original Inspiration**: Based on Dauntless Shield from official Pokemon games
- **Implementation**: Uses shared code with Dauntless Shield for consistency
