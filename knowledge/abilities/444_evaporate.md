# Evaporate - Ability ID 444

## In-Game Description
"Takes no damage and sets Mist if hit by water."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Evaporate negates all damage from Water-type moves and sets Mist for 5 turns on the user's side when hit by Water moves. Mist protects the entire team from stat reductions. Only activates if Mist is not already active. Perfect counter to Water attacks and stat-lowering moves.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Evaporate is a defensive ability that provides complete immunity to Water-type moves while also setting up team-wide protection. When hit by a Water-type move, the Pokemon takes no damage and automatically sets Mist if it's not already active.

### Activation Conditions
- **Move type requirement**: Only triggers on Water-type moves
- **Damage negation**: Completely negates all damage from Water-type moves
- **Mist condition**: Only sets Mist if not already active on the user's side
- **Duration**: Mist lasts for 5 turns when activated
- **Breakable**: Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker and similar abilities

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Evaporate in abilities.cc
constexpr Ability Evaporate = {
    .onAbsorb = +[](ON_ABSORB) -> int {
        CHECK(moveType == TYPE_WATER)
        return ABSORB_RESULT_EVAPORATE;
    },
    .breakable = TRUE,
};

// In battle_util.c - handles Mist setting
if (effect & ABSORB_RESULT_EVAPORATE && !gSideTimers[GetBattlerSide(battler)].mistTimer) {
    int side = GetBattlerSide(battler);
    gSideStatuses[side] |= SIDE_STATUS_MIST;
    gSideTimers[side].mistTimer = SCREEN_DURATION; // 5 turns
    // Trigger "became shrouded in Mist!" message
}
```

### Mist Effects
- **Stat protection**: Prevents all stat reductions for the entire team
- **Duration**: 5 turns (SCREEN_DURATION constant)
- **Team-wide**: Protects all Pokemon on the user's side
- **Message**: Displays "{Pokemon} became shrouded in Mist!" when activated
- **Overwrite protection**: Won't activate if Mist is already active

### Important Interactions
- **Multi-hit Water moves**: Each hit triggers absorption, but Mist only set once
- **Status effects**: Water moves with secondary effects (like Scald's burn) are completely negated
- **Substitute**: Bypasses Substitute since it's an absorbing ability
- **Z-Moves**: Completely negates Z-powered Water moves
- **Max Moves**: Negates damage but may not prevent secondary effects from Max Geyser
- **Ability suppression**: Disabled by Mold Breaker, Teravolt, Turboblaze, and Neutralizing Gas

### Water Move Coverage
Evaporate provides immunity to all Water-type moves including:
- **Physical**: Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Liquidation, Crabhammer
- **Special**: Surf, Hydro Pump, Scald, Water Pulse
- **Status**: No Water-type status moves to absorb
- **Multi-hit**: Scale Shot (if Water-type), etc.
- **Priority**: Aqua Jet immunity
- **Signature moves**: Steam Eruption, Origin Pulse, Prismatic Laser (if Water)

### Strategic Applications
- **Water immunity**: Complete shutdown of Water-type attackers
- **Team support**: Provides stat reduction protection for entire team
- **Stall counter**: Mist blocks stat drops from moves like Tickle, Charm, etc.
- **Intimidate counter**: Mist prevents Attack drops from Intimidate
- **Pivot utility**: Safe switch-in against Water moves with team benefits

### Synergies
- **Fire types**: Covers Water weakness while providing utility
- **Stat boosting**: Protects setup sweepers from stat drops
- **Clerical support**: Excellent on support Pokemon
- **Anti-stall**: Counters defensive strategies using stat drops
- **Team building**: Valuable on teams weak to Water coverage

### Counters and Limitations
- **Non-Water coverage**: Vulnerable to all other attacking types
- **Mist limitation**: No benefit if Mist is already active
- **Ability suppression**: Completely disabled by Mold Breaker variants
- **Weather immunity**: Cloud Nine/Air Lock don't affect this ability
- **Gastro Acid**: Can remove the ability entirely
- **Role Play/Skill Swap**: Can be copied or swapped away

### Competitive Usage
- **Water check**: Hard counter to Water-type attackers
- **Utility role**: Provides team support through Mist
- **Switch-in**: Safe entry against predicted Water moves
- **Anti-meta**: Effective against Water-heavy team compositions
- **Durability**: Increases effective bulk against Water coverage

### Common Matchups
- **Dominates**: Water-type specialists, mixed attackers with Water coverage
- **Supports**: Setup sweepers, frail teammates vulnerable to stat drops
- **Struggles against**: Pure physical/special attackers without Water moves
- **Neutral**: Most other type matchups remain unchanged

### Version History
- Custom Elite Redux ability (ID 444)
- Unique mechanic combining damage absorption with field effect
- Part of the expanded ability roster for competitive diversity
