## In-Game Description
"Steals 1/10 HP from foes each turn."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

Life Steal drains 1/10 of each opponent's maximum HP at the end of every turn and restores that amount to the user. Affects all living opponents simultaneously. Ignores substitutes and type immunities but can be blocked by Magic Guard. Provides consistent recovery and offensive pressure.

*Character count: 288*

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Life Steal is an aggressive end-of-turn ability that drains HP from all opposing Pokémon and heals the user. It provides both offensive pressure and defensive recovery, making it valuable for both offensive and defensive builds.

### Activation Conditions
- **Timing**: Activates at the end of each turn
- **Targets**: All living opponents on the opposing side
- **HP calculation**: Drains exactly 1/10 (10%) of each target's maximum HP
- **Recovery**: User gains HP equal to the total amount drained from all targets

### Technical Implementation
```c
// Life Steal implementation from abilities.cc
constexpr Ability LifeSteal = {
    .onEndTurn = +[](ON_END_TURN) -> int {
        int any = FALSE;
        for (int target = GetOppositeSide(battler); target < gBattlersCount; target += 2) {
            FILTER(IsBattlerAlive(target))
            FILTER_NOT(IsMagicGuardProtected(target))
            
            gStackBattler1 = battler;
            gStackBattler2 = target;
            gHitMarker |= HITMARKER_IGNORE_SUBSTITUTE | HITMARKER_PASSIVE_DAMAGE | HITMARKER_IGNORE_DISGUISE;
            BattleScriptExecute(BattleScript_AbilityDrainsHp);
            any = TRUE;
        }
        return any;
    },
};
```

### Battle Script Details
The ability uses `BattleScript_AbilityDrainsHp` which:
- Calculates damage as `hpfractiontodamage BS_STACK_2, 10` (1/10 max HP)
- Displays message: "{B_ATK_NAME_WITH_PREFIX} drains {B_DEF_NAME_WITH_PREFIX}'s health!"
- Updates HP bars and damage values
- Calls `BattleScript_AbsorbLeech` for the healing effect

### Important Interactions
- **Magic Guard protection**: Cannot drain HP from Pokémon with Magic Guard
- **Substitute bypass**: Ignores substitute protection (HITMARKER_IGNORE_SUBSTITUTE)
- **Disguise bypass**: Ignores Disguise protection (HITMARKER_IGNORE_DISGUISE)
- **Passive damage**: Marked as passive damage, affecting certain interactions
- **Multi-target**: Hits all living opponents, potentially draining massive HP in doubles
- **Type immunity**: Ignores type-based immunities

### Damage Calculations
- **Single opponent**: Drains 10% of opponent's max HP, heals user for same amount
- **Double battle**: Can drain from both opponents (up to 20% combined healing)
- **Maximum HP based**: Always drains based on target's max HP, not current HP
- **Minimum damage**: No minimum damage requirement - always drains exactly 10%

### Strategic Implications
- **Offensive pressure**: Continuous damage every turn without user action
- **Defensive recovery**: Provides consistent healing for longevity
- **Multi-target advantage**: Extremely powerful in double battles
- **Setup synergy**: Allows setup while still applying pressure
- **Anti-stall**: Counters defensive strategies with guaranteed damage
- **HP management**: Helps maintain high HP for abilities that require it

### Counters and Limitations
- **Magic Guard**: Completely blocks the HP drain
- **Ability suppression**: Mold Breaker, Neutralizing Gas disable the ability
- **Fainting**: No effect if all opponents are fainted
- **Heal Block**: May prevent the user from recovering HP (needs verification)
- **Weather**: Unaffected by weather conditions

### Synergies
- **Leftovers/Black Sludge**: Stacks with item-based recovery
- **Substitute**: Can hide behind substitute while draining
- **Status moves**: Free turns to set up while still dealing damage
- **Bulky builds**: Maximizes the healing received each turn
- **Double battles**: Potentially drain from multiple targets

### Competitive Usage Notes
- **Doubles powerhouse**: Incredibly strong in double battle formats
- **Stall breaker**: Forces progress in defensive matchups
- **Setup enabler**: Allows free setup turns with guaranteed value
- **HP threshold maintenance**: Helps stay above percentage-based thresholds
- **Late game pressure**: Becomes more impactful as battles progress
