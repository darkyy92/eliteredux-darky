# North Wind - Ability ID 348

## In-Game Description
"Automatically sets up Aurora Veil upon entry and immune to Hail."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Automatically sets up Aurora Veil upon entering battle, reducing physical and special damage by 50% for your entire team. Aurora Veil lasts 3 turns, or 5 turns with Light Clay. The user is also immune to Hail damage. Once activated, North Wind cannot trigger again if Aurora Veil is already active.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

### Overview

North Wind is an extremely powerful defensive ability that automatically sets up Aurora Veil upon entering battle. This ability provides immediate team support by reducing damage from both physical and special attacks by 50% for the user's entire team. Additionally, the user gains complete immunity to Hail damage, making it synergistic with Hail-based strategies.

## Mechanics

### Aurora Veil Setup
- **Duration**: 3 turns (base) or 5 turns if holding Light Clay
- **Effect**: Reduces damage from both physical and special attacks by 50%
- **Scope**: Affects the entire team on the user's side
- **Stacking**: Cannot be activated if Aurora Veil is already active

### Hail Immunity
- Complete immunity to Hail damage (1/16 HP per turn normally)
- Does not prevent other Hail effects or abilities from activating
- Allows safe switching in Hail weather conditions

## Code Implementation

### Primary Implementation
**File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
**Lines**: 3678-3694

```cpp
constexpr Ability NorthWind = {
    .onEntry = +[](ON_ENTRY) -> int {
        CHECK_NOT(gSideStatuses[GetBattlerSide(battler)] & SIDE_STATUS_AURORA_VEIL)

        int side = GetBattlerSide(battler);
        gSideTimers[side].started.auroraVeil = TRUE;
        gSideStatuses[side] |= SIDE_STATUS_AURORA_VEIL;
        if (GetBattlerHoldEffect(battler, TRUE) == HOLD_EFFECT_LIGHT_CLAY)
            gSideTimers[side].auroraVeilTimer = SCREEN_DURATION;
        else
            gSideTimers[side].auroraVeilTimer = SCREEN_DURATION_SHORT;
        BattleScriptPushCursorAndCallback(BattleScript_NorthWindActivated);

        return TRUE;
    },
    .hailImmune = TRUE,
};
```

### Constants
- `SCREEN_DURATION_SHORT = 3` (base Aurora Veil duration)
- `SCREEN_DURATION = 5` (Light Clay extended duration)

### Battle Message
**File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/battle_message.c`
**Message**: "{B_ACTIVE_NAME_WITH_PREFIX}'s North Wind set up Aurora Veil!"

## Strategic Applications

### Weather Synergy

- **Weather Wars**: Can safely enter against opposing Hail setters
- **Mixed Weather**: Provides consistent defensive utility regardless of weather

### Light Clay Synergy
