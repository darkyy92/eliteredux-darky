# Restraining Order - Ability ID 690

## In-Game Description
Forces attacker to switch out when hit by contact moves (once per switch-in).

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

When hit by a contact move, Restraining Order forces the attacker to switch out to a random ally. This defensive mechanism triggers only once per switch-in. After activation, the ability remains dormant until this Pokemon switches out and returns to battle, resetting the one-time trigger.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Restraining Order is a defensive ability that acts as a deterrent against attackers. When a Pokemon with this ability is hit by a move that makes contact, it automatically forces the attacker to switch out of battle. This effect only triggers once per switch-in, making it a one-time defensive measure that requires strategic positioning to maximize its effectiveness.
