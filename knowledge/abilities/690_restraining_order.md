# Restraining Order

Restraining Order is a defensive ability that acts as a deterrent against attackers. When a PokÃ©mon with this ability is hit by a move that makes contact, it automatically forces the attacker to switch out of battle. This effect only triggers once per switch-in, making it a one-time defensive measure that requires strategic positioning to maximize its effectiveness.
