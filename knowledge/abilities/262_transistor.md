# Transistor - Ability ID 262

## In-Game Description
"Boosts the power of Electric-type moves by 1.5x."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Transistor amplifies the power of all Electric-type moves by 50%, making them hit with 1.5x damage. This boost applies to any Electric move the Pokemon uses, including physical moves like Thunder Punch and special moves like Thunderbolt. Stacks multiplicatively with other damage modifiers.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Transistor is a straightforward damage-boosting ability that provides a consistent 1.5x power multiplier to all Electric-type moves used by the Pokemon that has this ability.

**Key Mechanics:**
- **Type-Specific Boost**: Only affects Electric-type moves, regardless of move category (physical, special, or status moves that deal damage)
- **Multiplicative Stacking**: The 1.5x multiplier stacks multiplicatively with other damage modifiers such as STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), type effectiveness, items like Choice Band/Specs, stat boosts, weather effects, and field effects
- **Move Coverage**: Affects all damaging Electric moves including but not limited to:
  - Physical: Thunder Punch, Wild Charge, Spark, Volt Tackle
  - Special: Thunderbolt, Thunder, Discharge, Electro Ball
  - Multi-hit: Pin Missile (if Electric-type through Normalize + Electrify combo)

**Implementation Details:**
- Implemented via the `onOffensiveMultiplier` callback in the Elite Redux ability system
- Triggers during damage calculation phase before final damage is applied
- Does not affect non-damaging Electric moves (Thunder Wave, etc.)
- The boost is applied even if the move is resisted or not very effective

**Competitive Usage:**
Transistor is essentially the Electric-type equivalent of abilities like Blaze, Torrent, and Overgrow, but provides a constant boost rather than an emergency boost at low HP. This makes it particularly valuable for Electric-type Pokemon that want consistent damage output throughout the battle.

**Similar Abilities:**
- Dragon's Maw (Dragon-type moves)
- Steelworker (Steel-type moves) 
- Pixilate/Aerilate/Refrigerate (type conversion + boost)
- Tough Claws (contact moves)
