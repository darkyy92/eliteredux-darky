# Blood Stain

**Type:** Infectious Contact Ability  
**ID:** 673

## Overview
Blood Stain is a devastating ability that creates a constantly bleeding Pokémon that spreads its condition to others on contact. This ability simulates an infectious bleeding state that bypasses traditional status immunities.

## Extended Description
This terrifying ability causes the user to perpetually bleed, taking 1/16 maximum HP damage each turn. The bleeding condition cannot be healed by any means and spreads to opposing Pokémon making physical contact. Ghost and Rock types are immune to infection, but the original user remains affected.
