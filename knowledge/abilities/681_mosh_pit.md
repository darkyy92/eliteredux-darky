# Mosh Pit

**Effect:** Boosts ally's offensive moves by 1.5x damage. If the ally uses a recoil move, the boost is reduced to 1.25x instead.

This ability creates a chaotic battlefield environment that energizes allies, giving them a significant power boost. The boost is stronger for regular attacks but slightly weaker for reckless recoil moves, as the user becomes more focused on avoiding self-harm in the frenzied atmosphere.
