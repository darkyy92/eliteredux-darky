# Flame Coat - Ability ID 775

## In-Game Description
"Non-Fire-types take 1/8 dmg every turn when on field."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Creates a blazing aura that scorches all non-Fire-type Pokemon on the battlefield. At the end of each turn, all non-Fire-types suffer burns equivalent to 1/8 of their maximum HP, creating a punishing environment that favors Fire-types and forces strategic switching.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

Flame Coat is a powerful field control ability that creates an environmental hazard affecting all non-Fire-type Pokemon on the battlefield.

### Activation Requirements
- Triggers automatically at the end of each turn when the user is on the field
- Does not require the user to be active; works as long as they're conscious and on the field

### Targeting and Effects
- **Targets**: All conscious non-Fire-type Pokemon on the battlefield (including allies in double battles)
- **Damage**: Exactly 1/8 of the target's maximum HP per turn
- **Damage Type**: Direct HP reduction (not affected by type effectiveness or stats)

### Immunities and Protections
The following abilities and conditions prevent Flame Coat damage:
- **Magic Guard**: Completely blocks the damage
- **Flare Boost**: The ability user is immune to Flame Coat damage
- **Fire-type Pokemon**: Naturally immune due to typing
- **Fainted Pokemon**: Cannot be affected

### Visual and Audio Effects
- **Switch-in**: Displays a special announcement message when the user enters battle
- **Damage Animation**: Uses the burn status animation when dealing damage
- **Message**: Shows "POKÃ‰MON was hurt by the blazing heat!" or similar

### Strategic Applications

**Offensive Use:**
- Forces non-Fire-types to either switch out or take continuous damage
- Excellent for wearing down bulky walls and tanks
- Can pressure healing strategies by dealing consistent damage
- Synergizes well with trapping moves like Block or Mean Look

**Team Building Considerations:**
- Best used on bulky Fire-types that can stay on the field long-term
- Pairs excellently with other Fire-types to create mono-Fire advantage
- Consider using with Pokemon that have good defensive stats to maintain field presence

**Counterplay:**
- Switch to Fire-type Pokemon to avoid damage entirely
- Use Magic Guard Pokemon (like Clefable or Alakazam) for immunity
- Employ hit-and-run tactics to minimize exposure time
- Use healing moves more frequently to offset the damage

### Comparison to Similar Abilities
- **Rough Skin/Iron Barbs**: Flame Coat affects all non-Fire-types continuously vs. contact-based retaliation
- **Sand Stream/Snow Warning**: Creates weather vs. direct HP damage
- **Toxic Spikes**: Entry hazard vs. continuous field effect

### Notable Interactions
- Does not stack with multiple Flame Coat users
- Works in conjunction with weather effects like Sandstorm
- Can be particularly devastating in combination with entry hazards
- Effect persists even if the user switches out (as long as they remain conscious)

Flame Coat represents one of the most powerful field control abilities in Elite Redux, capable of single-handedly shifting team dynamics and forcing opponents to adapt their strategies around Fire-type immunity.
