# Stamina - Ability ID 192

## In-Game Description
"Raises Defense by 1 stage when hit. Critical hits raise Defense by 12 stages."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Stamina transforms each hit taken into defensive strength. Normal attacks raise Defense by one stage, turning continuous damage into progressive fortification. Critical hits trigger an exceptional response, instantly maximizing Defense to +600%. This creates a risk-reward dynamic.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Stamina is a defensive ability that converts incoming damage into defensive power. Each time the Pokemon takes damage, it gains a Defense boost, with critical hits providing an enormous defensive advantage.

### Basic Effect
- **Normal Hits**: Raises Defense by 1 stage (+50% Defense)
- **Critical Hits**: Raises Defense by 12 stages (maximizes Defense at +600%)

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
constexpr Ability Stamina = {
    .onDefender = +[](ON_DEFENDER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(battler))
        CHECK(CanRaiseStat(battler, STAT_DEF))

        if (gIsCriticalHit) {
            SetStatChanger(STAT_DEF, 12);
            BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_TargetsStatWasMaxedOut);
        } else {
            SetStatChanger(STAT_DEF, 1);
            BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_TargetAbilityStatRaiseOnMoveEnd);
        }
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Trigger Conditions
- Must be hit by a damaging move
- Defense stat must not be at maximum (+6 stages)
- Subject to `ShouldApplyOnHitAffect` restrictions

## Strategic Applications

### Defensive Walls
Perfect for defensive Pokemon like:
- **Bastiodon**: Already has massive Defense, becomes nearly unbreakable
- **Mudsdale**: Innate Stamina makes it an exceptional physical wall
- **Rhyperior**: Assault Vest + Stamina creates a mixed defensive threat

### Bulky Setup Sweepers
Enables aggressive defensive setups:
- **Conkeldurr**: Can set up with Bulk Up while gaining passive Defense
- **Chesnaught**: Becomes incredibly bulky while setting up screens
- **Torterra**: Curse + Stamina creates unstoppable physical presence

### Critical Hit Abuse
- **Hariyama**: With Skill Link, can potentially bait criticals for massive boosts
- **Swampert**: Defensive Mega evolution becomes even more formidable

This ability fundamentally changes how damage is perceived - every attack that doesn't knock out the Pokemon makes it stronger. The critical hit mechanism provides a powerful comeback potential, as a single critical hit can transform a Pokemon into an impenetrable fortress. Stamina excels on Pokemon with naturally high HP and defensive stats, as they can survive initial hits to begin accumulating defensive boosts.

## Competitive Viability

### Strengths
- Excellent on defensive walls and bulky attackers
- Provides passive Defense boosts without requiring setup moves
- Critical hit protection creates massive defensive spikes
- Works with all damaging moves (contact and non-contact)

### Weaknesses
- Provides no protection against special attacks
- Requires surviving hits to gain benefit
- Can be overwhelmed by powerful special attackers
- No benefit if Defense is already maximized

### Synergistic Items
- **Leftovers**: Sustains longevity to accumulate more boosts
- **Assault Vest**: Complements Defense boosts with Special Defense
- **Rocky Helmet**: Punishes contact moves while gaining Defense
- **Eviolite**: On pre-evolutions like Marshtomp for extreme bulk

## Notable Pokemon

### Mudsdale
- **Role**: Premier Stamina user with innate ability
- **Strategy**: Defensive wall with Counter and recovery moves
- **EVs**: Max HP/Defense investment for optimal bulk

### Swampert Line
- **Marshtomp**: Eviolite + Stamina creates incredible mid-stage bulk
- **Swampert**: Defensive sets with Flip Turn for momentum
- **Mega Swampert**: Retains Stamina before mega evolution

### Conkeldurr
- **Role**: Mixed defensive/offensive threat
- **Strategy**: Flame Orb activation + Guts while building Defense
- **Applications**: Doubles play with Swagger support

## Interactions and Edge Cases

### Stat Stage Limitations
- Will not trigger if Defense is at +6 stages
- `CanRaiseStat` check prevents unnecessary triggers

### Battle Script Integration
- Normal hits use `BattleScript_TargetAbilityStatRaiseOnMoveEnd`
- Critical hits use `BattleScript_TargetsStatWasMaxedOut`
- Proper battle messaging for both scenarios

### Multi-Hit Moves
- Each individual hit can trigger Stamina
- Particularly effective against moves like Bullet Seed or Rock Blast

Stamina represents one of the most unique defensive abilities, converting adversity into advantage through its innovative damage-to-defense conversion mechanism.
