# Precise Fist - Ability ID 375

## In-Game Description
"Punching moves get +1 crit and 5x effect chance."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Punching moves land guaranteed critical hits and have 5x their normal secondary effect chance. Works with all Iron Fist-boosted moves including elemental punches, priority punches, and Fighting-type attacks. The critical hit boost stacks with abilities like Sniper for devastating damage output.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

**PRECISE FIST** is a specialized enhancement ability that transforms punching moves into highly reliable, devastating attacks with both guaranteed critical hits and amplified secondary effects.

### Activation Mechanics:
- **Critical Hit Trigger**: onCrit callback (line 3896-3899)
- **Effect Amplification**: onModifyEffectChance callback (line 3900-3903)
- **Condition**: Move must have FLAG_IRON_FIST_BOOST flag (same as Iron Fist)
- **Type**: Universal - works with all move types that have punching flag

### Core Effects:
1. **Guaranteed Critical Hits**: All punching moves automatically score critical hits
2. **5x Secondary Effect Chance**: Status effect chances are multiplied by 5 (e.g., 10% becomes 50%)

### Affected Moves:
Precise Fist affects all moves with the FLAG_IRON_FIST_BOOST flag, including:

1. **Elemental Punches**: Fire Punch (10% burn to 50%), Ice Punch (10% freeze to 50%), Thunder Punch (10% paralysis to 50%)
2. **Fighting Punches**: Dynamic Punch (100% confusion - already guaranteed), Drain Punch, Focus Punch
3. **Priority Punches**: Bullet Punch, Mach Punch
4. **Other Punching Moves**: Comet Punch, Mega Punch, Dizzy Punch (20% confusion to 100%), Shadow Punch
5. **Special Cases**: Hammer Arm, Meteor Mash, Sky Uppercut, Power-Up Punch

### Technical Implementation:
```cpp
constexpr Ability PreciseFist = {
    .onCrit = +[](ON_CRIT) -> int {
        CHECK(IsIronFistBoosted(battler, move))
        return 1;  // Guaranteed critical hit
    },
    .onModifyEffectChance =
        +[](ON_MODIFY_EFFECT_CHANCE) {
            if (IsIronFistBoosted(battler, move)) *effectChance *= 5;
        },
};
```

### Secondary Effect Examples:
- **Fire Punch**: 10% burn chance to 50% burn chance + guaranteed crit
- **Ice Punch**: 10% freeze chance to 50% freeze chance + guaranteed crit  
- **Thunder Punch**: 10% paralysis to 50% paralysis + guaranteed crit
- **Dizzy Punch**: 20% confusion to 100% confusion + guaranteed crit
- **Meteor Mash**: 20% Attack boost to 100% Attack boost + guaranteed crit

### Critical Hit Calculation:
The guaranteed critical hit multiplies damage by:
- **Physical moves**: 1.5x base damage (2.25x in Gen 6+)
- **Stacks with**: Sniper (3x crit damage), critical hit items
- **Base Example**: 100 BP Fire Punch to 150 BP with crit to 225 BP with Sniper

### Strategic Applications:
1. **Status Spreader**: Elemental punches become highly reliable status moves
2. **Sweeping Power**: Guaranteed crits break through defensive investment
3. **Setup Synergy**: Meteor Mash becomes 100% reliable Attack boost
4. **Priority Pressure**: Bullet Punch becomes a guaranteed crit priority move
