# White Noise

White Noise combines the effects of Static and Peaceful Rest. This Pok√©mon has a 30% chance to paralyze opponents that make contact with physical attacks, utilizing electrical discharge as a defensive mechanism. Additionally, it heals 1/8 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn during foggy weather conditions, recovering naturally in misty environments.
