# Jackhammer

Jackhammer transforms hammer-based moves into devastating double strikes. When using any hammer move, it hits twice in succession. The first hit deals full damage, while the second strike connects for 70% power, creating a reliable combo that breaks through Substitutes and Focus Sash items.
