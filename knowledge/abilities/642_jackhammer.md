# Jackhammer - Ability ID 642

## In-Game Description
Hammer moves hit twice in succession.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Hammer moves to hit twice, with each hit dealing 70% of the move's normal damage. Secondary effects roll independently for each hit.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Jackhammer transforms hammer-based moves into devastating double strikes. When using any hammer move, it hits twice in succession. The first hit deals full damage, while the second strike connects for 70% power, creating a reliable combo that breaks through Substitutes and Focus Sash items.
