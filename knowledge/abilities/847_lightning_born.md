# Lightning Born - Ability ID 847

## In-Game Description
Grants Electric-type as a third type when entering battle.

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Grants Electric-type as a third type when entering battle. This additional typing stacks with the Pokemon's original types, adding Electric resistances (Flying, Steel, Electric 0.5x) and weakness (Ground 2x). The Pokemon gains STAB on Electric moves and all type interactions are recalculated.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

This ability transforms any Pokemon into a partial Electric-type by adding Electric as a third type slot, providing new resistances and STAB opportunities while maintaining the original typing.
