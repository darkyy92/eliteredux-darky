# Lightning Born

Grants Electric-type as a third type when entering battle. This additional typing stacks with the Pokemon's original types, adding Electric resistances (Flying, Steel, Electric 0.5x) and weakness (Ground 2x). The Pokemon gains STAB on Electric moves and all type interactions are recalculated.
