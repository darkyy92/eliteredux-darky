# Oblivious - Ability ID 12

## In-Game Description
"Immune to infatuation, Scare, Intimidate and Taunt."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

This Pokemon is immune to infatuation and move-restricting effects like Taunt, Disable, Encore, and Torment. Maintains focus in battle, ignoring attempts to limit its move choices. Setup sweepers can boost freely without Taunt fear, and walls can use recovery moves unimpeded by disruption.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Oblivious provides immunity to multiple mental/restriction effects:

1. **Infatuation Immunity**
   - Cannot be infatuated by any means
   - Includes Attract, Cute Charm, etc.
   - Removes existing infatuation when gained

2. **Restriction Immunity** (CHECK_RESTRICTING)
   - **Taunt**: Cannot be taunted
   - **Disable**: Cannot have moves disabled  
   - **Encore**: Cannot be locked into moves
   - **Torment**: Cannot be prevented from using same move

### Technical Implementation

**Code Structure** (`src/abilities.cc`):
```cpp
constexpr Ability Oblivious = {
    .onStatusImmune = +[](ABILITY_ON_STATUS_IMMUNE) -> int {
        CHECK(status & CHECK_INFATUATE)
        CHECK(status & CHECK_RESTRICTING)
        return TRUE;
    },
    .tauntImmune = TRUE,
    .breakable = TRUE,
    .removesStatusOnImmunity = TRUE,
};
```

### Important Note
Despite the description mentioning "Intimidate immunity," the actual implementation does NOT provide immunity to Intimidate's Attack reduction. This is a description error.

### What CHECK_RESTRICTING Includes
From battle code analysis:
- Active Taunt timer
- Active Disable timer  
- Active Encore timer
- Torment status effect

### Key Properties
- **Breakable**: Can be suppressed by Mold Breaker
- **Status Removal**: Clears restrictions when gained
- **Ability Popup**: Shows when effects are blocked

### Strategic Implications

1. **Setup Sweeper Protection**
   - Can't be Taunted out of setup moves
   - Can't be Encored into setup moves
   - Maintains move flexibility

2. **Stall Breaking**
   - Ignores Taunt on recovery moves
   - Can't be Disabled out of key moves
   - Full moveset always available

3. **Attract Immunity**
   - Gender-based strategies fail
   - Cute Charm contact safe

### Battle Scenarios

**vs Taunt Lead**: 
- Opponent uses Taunt to Fails
- Can still use Stealth Rock, Recover, etc.

**vs Encore Trap**:
- Uses Protect to Opponent uses Encore to Fails
- Not locked into Protect

**vs Disable**:
- Uses Hydro Pump to Opponent uses Disable to Fails
- Can continue using Hydro Pump

### Common Oblivious Users
- **Slowbro/Slowking**: Defensive walls
- **Swinub line**: Physical attackers

### Competitive Usage Notes
- B-tier utility ability
- Excellent on defensive Pokemon
- Valuable for setup sweepers
- Counters common disruption strategies
- AI rates it relatively low (2/10)

### What It Doesn't Block
- **Intimidate**: Attack drops still occur
- **Scare moves**: If they exist separately
- **Imprison**: Move locking via shared moves
- **Heal Block**: Recovery prevention
- **Embargo**: Item prevention

### Counters
- **Mold Breaker**: Bypasses Oblivious
- **Direct damage**: No defensive benefits
- **Status conditions**: Burn, paralysis work normally
- **Stat reduction**: Intimidate, Screech work

### Synergies

- **Recovery moves**: Rest, Recover can't be Taunted
- **Choice items**: Less punishable with Encore immunity
- **Substitute**: Can't be Encored into it
- **Baton Pass**: Pass boosts without Taunt fear

- **Inner Focus**: Flinch immunity
- **Own Tempo**: Confusion immunity
