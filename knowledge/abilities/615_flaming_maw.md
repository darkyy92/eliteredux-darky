## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Flaming Maw is a compound ability that enhances jaw-based moves with both increased damage and a powerful burn effect, making it ideal for Pokemon that rely on biting and fang attacks.

- **Dual Benefit**: Both effects apply simultaneously

- **Poison Fang**: Poison-type with badly poison chance
- **Psychic Fangs**: Psychic-type that destroys screens
- **Bolt Beak**: Electric-type with speed-based power
