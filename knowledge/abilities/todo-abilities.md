# Abilities Needing Complete Regeneration

These files are missing too much structure/content to fix with simple edits. They need to be regenerated completely.

## Files to Regenerate

- [ ] 837_chokehold.md - Missing headers, extended description too short (236 chars, need 280-300)
- [ ] 839_neutralizing_fog.md - Extended description too short ("Uses Defog on entry." ~20 chars, need 280-300)
- [ ] 845_impaler.md - Extended description too short (208 chars, need 280-300)
- [ ] 855_hyper_cleanse.md - Missing structure, extended description too long (~700+ chars, need 280-300)

## Notes

- All files here need proper structure: frontmatter, header with ID, In-Game Description, Extended In-Game Description (280-300 chars), Detailed Mechanical Explanation
- Extended descriptions must be exactly 280-300 characters INCLUDING spaces
- Must preserve the meta-comment line: `*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*`
