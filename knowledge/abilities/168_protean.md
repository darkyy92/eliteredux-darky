# Protean (Ability ID: 168)

## Overview
Protean is a type-changing ability that allows the user to change their type to match the type of the move they are about to use, providing Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) for all moves.

## Mechanics

### Core Functionality
- **Trigger**: Before using any move (except Struggle)
- **Effect**: Changes the user's type to match the move's type
- **Restriction**: Only activates once per turn per ability instance
- **Condition**: Only activates if the user is not already the same type as the move

### Implementation Details
```cpp
// From abilities.cc lines 1854-1864
constexpr Ability Protean = {
    .onBeforeAttack = +[](ABILITY_ON_BEFORE_ATTACK) -> int {
        CHECK(CheckAndSetOncePerTurnAbility(battler, ability))
        CHECK_NOT(IS_BATTLER_OF_TYPE(battler, moveType))
        CHECK(move != MOVE_STRUGGLE)
        SET_BATTLER_TYPE(gBattlerAttacker, moveType);
        PREPARE_TYPE_BUFFER(gBattleTextBuff1, moveType);
        BattleScriptCall(BattleScript_ProteanActivates);
        return TRUE;
    },
};
```

### Battle Message
When Protean activates, the message displayed is:
**"[Pokemon name] transformed into the [type] type!"**

## Strategic Applications

### Offensive Benefits
- **STAB Bonus**: All moves receive 1.5x damage multiplier
- **Type Coverage**: Allows for diverse movesets with consistent power
- **Unpredictability**: Opponents cannot predict the user's type

### Defensive Considerations
- **Type Vulnerability**: Changing type may introduce new weaknesses
- **Timing**: Type change occurs before the move, affecting incoming damage calculations
- **Once Per Turn**: Limited to one activation per turn, requiring strategic move selection

## Limitations

### Usage Restrictions
- **Once Per Turn**: Cannot activate multiple times in the same turn
- **Struggle Exception**: Does not activate when using Struggle
- **Same Type Check**: Will not activate if already the same type as the move

### Strategic Limitations
- **Defensive Exposure**: May change to a type weak to opponent's moves
- **Prediction**: Experienced players can anticipate type changes
- **Move Selection**: Must consider both offensive and defensive type implications

## Interactions

### Related Abilities
- **Color Change**: Changes type when hit by a move (defensive vs. offensive)
- **Libero**: Functionally identical to Protean (same effect, different name)

### Battle Mechanics
- **Priority**: Activates before the move executes
- **Multi-Hit Moves**: Only changes type once per turn, not per hit
- **Switch Out**: Type reverts to base type when switching out

## Extended Description
"Changes the user's type to match the type of the move being used before attacking, granting Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) to all moves. This ability only activates once per turn and will not trigger if the user is already the same type as the move being used, except for Struggle."

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
