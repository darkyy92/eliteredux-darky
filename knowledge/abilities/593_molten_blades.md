# Molten Blades - Ability ID 593

## In-Game Description
"Slicing moves gain 30% power and 20% burn chance."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (280-300 chars max)*

Molten Blades superheats slicing attacks, boosting damage by 30% while adding 20% burn chance. Works with Slash, Night Slash, Leaf Blade, Sacred Sword, and all Keen Edge-boosted moves. The combination of immediate power and burn potential makes every slice a dual threat to opponents.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation

Molten Blades enhances slicing and cutting moves with both raw power and searing heat. This ability combines the damage boost of Keen Edge with a burn chance, creating a dual-threat offensive ability that punishes physical defenders while amplifying slicing move damage.

### Technical Implementation

### Code Location
- **File**: `/Users/joel/Github/eliteredux/eliteredux-source/src/abilities.cc`
- **Implementation**: Combines Keen Edge boost with burn effect

### Core Mechanics
```cpp
constexpr Ability MoltenBlades = {
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(ShouldApplyOnHitAffect(target))
        CHECK(CanBeBurned(target))
        CHECK(gBattleMoves[move].flags & FLAG_KEEN_EDGE_BOOST)
        CHECK(Random() % 100 < 20)

        return AbilityStatusEffect(MOVE_EFFECT_BURN);
    },
    .onOffensiveMultiplier = KeenEdge.onOffensiveMultiplier,
};
```

### Effect Components
1. **Damage Boost**: 30% increase (1.3x) to all slicing moves

### Conclusion

Molten Blades exemplifies Elite Redux's design philosophy of combining existing mechanics in creative ways.

This ability rewards players who can effectively utilize slicing moves while punishing physical-based teams. Its Medium-High tier reflects its consistent value without being oppressive, making it an excellent choice for Pokemon with access to diverse slicing moves who want to combine offensive pressure with defensive utility.
