# Cryo Proficiency - Ability ID 493

## In-Game Description
"Freezing Point + summons hail on contact + hail immunity."

## Extended In-Game Description
*For use in Elite Redux extended ability UI (IMPORTANT: exactly 280-300 chars counted WITH spaces)*

When this Pokemon makes contact with an opponent, there's a 30% chance to inflict frostbite. Additionally, on successful contact hits, this Pokemon summons hail if no hail is active. The Pokemon is immune to hail damage, allowing it to thrive in the icy conditions it creates.

## Detailed Mechanical Explanation
*For Discord/reference use*

### Core Mechanics
Cryo Proficiency is an enhanced version of Freezing Point that combines frostbite infliction with weather control, creating a master of ice-based battlefield manipulation.

### Triple Effect Components

#### 1. Freezing Point Inheritance
- **Contact frostbite**: 30% chance to inflict frostbite on contact moves
- **Status effect**: Frostbite deals 1/8 HP per turn and halves Special Attack
- **Defensive utility**: Punishes contact move users with debilitating status

#### 2. Hail Summoning
- **Trigger**: When the Pokemon successfully hits with a contact move
- **Condition**: Only summons hail if no hail weather is currently active
- **Duration**: Standard hail duration (8 turns in Elite Redux)
- **Control**: Creates advantageous weather conditions on demand

#### 3. Hail Immunity
- **Damage immunity**: Takes no damage from hail weather
- **Weather advantage**: Can operate freely in hail while opponents suffer
- **Synergy**: Combines perfectly with self-summoned hail

### Technical Implementation
```c
constexpr Ability CryoProficiency = {
    .onDefender = FreezingPoint.onDefender,  // 30% frostbite on contact
    .onAttacker = +[](ON_ATTACKER) -> int {
        CHECK(IsMoveMakingContact(gCurrentMove))
        return CryoProficiencyHail(battler);  // Summon hail if not active
    },
    .hailImmune = TRUE,  // Immune to hail damage
};
```

### Hail Weather Effects
- **Damage**: 1/16 max HP per turn to non-Ice types
- **Accuracy**: Blizzard never misses in hail
- **Move boosts**: Aurora Veil can be used
- **Duration**: 8 turns base (can be extended with items)
- **Synergy**: Works with other hail-based abilities

### Strategic Applications
- **Weather control**: Establishes favorable conditions through combat
- **Status spreading**: Combines weather damage with frostbite
- **Ice synergy**: Enables ice-type strategies and move synergies
- **Field dominance**: Controls battlefield conditions through presence
- **Defensive layering**: Multiple forms of passive damage and debuffing

### Contact Move Synergies
**Optimal contact moves:**
- Ice Punch: Thematic ice attack that can summon hail
- Body Slam: Reliable contact move for weather setup
- U-turn: Hit and switch while setting up hail for team
- Rapid Spin: Clear hazards while establishing weather
- Drain Punch: Healing while creating battlefield control

### Weather Team Applications
- **Hail setter**: Reliable weather setting without using a move slot
- **Weather maintainer**: Can re-establish hail through combat
- **Ice-type support**: Enables team strategies around hail weather
- **Blizzard accuracy**: Team can use Blizzard with perfect accuracy
- **Aurora Veil setup**: Enables defensive screen strategies

### Double Battle Considerations
- **Team protection**: Hail damages opposing team but not user
- **Weather wars**: Can contest opposing weather through combat
- **Ally synergy**: Supports ice-type partners with weather
- **Field control**: Passive damage affects multiple opponents
- **Positioning**: Contact moves need careful targeting

### Defensive Applications
- **Contact deterrent**: Multiple punishments for contact moves
- **Passive damage**: Hail + frostbite create sustained damage
- **Special attack debuff**: Frostbite weakens special attackers
- **Weather immunity**: Operates freely in self-created conditions
- **Status immunity**: Ice-types often resist ice-based status

### Limitations
- **Contact requirement**: Both effects need contact moves to trigger
- **Weather dependency**: Less effective when hail is already active
- **Ice immunity**: Ice-types resist frostbite and are hail-immune
- **Contact immunity**: Some abilities prevent contact altogether
- **Weather wars**: Opposing weather can override hail

### Counters
- **Long-range attackers**: Avoid contact completely
- **Weather control**: Override hail with other weather
- **Ice-types**: Immune to both hail and often frostbite
- **Substitute**: Blocks contact and prevents both effects
- **Cloud Nine/Air Lock**: Negates weather benefits

### Item Synergies
- **Icy Rock**: Extends hail duration for maximum field control
- **Leftovers**: Offsets hail damage for non-Ice teammates
- **Rocky Helmet**: Additional contact punishment
- **Never-Melt Ice**: Boosts ice-type moves in created hail
- **Safety Goggles**: Protects allies from hail damage

### Competitive Usage
- **Weather setter**: Alternative to Abomasnow/Alolan Ninetales
- **Defensive wall**: Multiple forms of contact punishment
- **Team enabler**: Sets up conditions for ice-type teammates
- **Field controller**: Manages battlefield conditions actively
- **Hybrid role**: Combines offense, defense, and support

### Pokemon Suitability
Ideal for Pokemon with:
- **Ice typing**: Natural synergy with hail and ice moves
- **High Defense**: Can survive contact moves to trigger effects
- **Contact moves**: Can actively summon hail through offense
- **Bulk**: Survives long enough to establish weather control
- **Support role**: Benefits team through weather and status

### Version History
- Elite Redux custom ability expanding on Freezing Point
- Designed for comprehensive ice-type battlefield control
- Part of weather manipulation ability expansion
- Combines status, weather, and immunity for unique gameplay
