Infiltrator allows moves to bypass protective effects that would normally block or reduce damage. All moves ignore Substitute dolls and damage reduction screens like Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil. Also bypasses Mist when using stat-lowering moves, ensuring attacks connect at full power.

Justified activates when hit by Dark-type moves, granting immunity to damage and raising the user's highest attacking stat by 1 stage. Whether Attack or Special Attack increases depends on which is naturally higher with stat boosts considered. Pairs well with switch-ins.

# ID: 155
Rattled boosts Speed by one stage when hit by Bug, Dark, or Ghost-type moves. The boost applies after damage calculation but before the move ends. Only triggers on moves that deal damage and doesn't activate if the Pokémon faints from the hit. Provides defensive utility by turning weaknesses into opportunities.

Magic Bounce automatically reflects most status moves back to the user before they can take effect. The bounced move targets the original user with no additional accuracy check. Works against moves like Toxic, Leech Seed, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp but not damaging moves or self-targeting status moves.

Iron Barbs deals 1/8 maximum HP damage to attackers using contact moves. Damage is based on the attacker's max HP, not current HP. Magic Guard blocks this retaliation damage. Always deals at least 1 HP damage even if 1/8 calculation rounds to 0. Functions identically to Rough Skin.
