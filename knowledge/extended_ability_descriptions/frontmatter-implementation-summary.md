# Frontmatter Implementation Summary

## What's Been Done ✅

### 1. Core Scripts Created
- **generate_progress.py** - Reads frontmatter from all ability files and generates progress.md
- **process_github_issues_updated.py** - Updates frontmatter when processing community reviews
- **analyze-ability-updated.md** - Updated slash command that adds frontmatter to new files
- **batch-analyze-prompt-updated.md** - Updated batch prompt with frontmatter requirements

### 2. Codex Visual Indicators
- **config.mjs** - Updated to read frontmatter and show ✅ for reviewed abilities
- **package.json** - Added gray-matter dependency
- **custom.css** - Already had styles, works with the checkmarks

### 3. Documentation
- **frontmatter-migration-plan.md** - Comprehensive plan with all details
- **config-update-notes.md** - Instructions for the Codex updates

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Install Dependencies (Codex)
```bash
cd eliteredux-darky/codex
npm install  # This will install gray-matter
```

### 2. Test the New Workflow
1. Use the updated slash command or batch prompt to analyze a new ability
2. Verify it creates files with frontmatter
3. Run `python eliteredux-darky/scripts/ability_tools/generate_progress.py`
4. Check that progress.md is generated correctly

### 3. Test GitHub Issue Processing
```bash
python eliteredux-darky/scripts/ability_tools/process_github_issues_updated.py --dry-run
```

### 4. Test Codex Visual Indicators
```bash
cd eliteredux-darky/codex
npm run dev
# Check that reviewed abilities show ✅ in sidebar
```

### 5. Migration of Existing Abilities (When Ready)
This is saved for last after testing. We'll need to:
- Create a migration script to add frontmatter to 153+ existing files
- Set them all as `status: ai-generated`
- Extract character counts from existing files
- Run generate_progress.py to rebuild progress.md

## Key Changes to Remember

1. **No more manual progress.md edits** - Always use generate_progress.py
2. **Frontmatter is required** - All new ability files must have it
3. **Review status tracking** - Frontmatter tracks who reviewed and when
4. **Visual feedback** - Codex now shows ✅ for reviewed abilities

## Files to Use Going Forward

- **Slash command**: `/project:analyze-ability` (now includes frontmatter)
- **Batch prompt**: Use the one in `batch-analyze-prompt-updated.md`
- **GitHub processing**: Use `process_github_issues_updated.py`
- **Progress generation**: Always run `generate_progress.py` after changes
