# Extended Ability Description Writing Patterns

This document tracks verified patterns for writing extended ability descriptions. These patterns help maintain consistency and avoid re-researching similar abilities.

## Verified Patterns

### Weather Abilities
- **Duration**: "Lasts 8 turns" (verified in code)
- **Overrides**: New weather replaces old weather
- **Effects**: [To be documented as we verify]

### Stat Multipliers
- **"Doubles Attack"**: Multiplies final stat, not base stat
- **Stacking**: [To be verified]

### Type Immunities
