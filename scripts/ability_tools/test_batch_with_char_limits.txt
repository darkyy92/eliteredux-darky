# Test Batch - Extended Descriptions with Character Limits

Based on UI analysis: 30 chars per line, 11 usable lines = 280-300 chars practical limit

## Examples Within Limits

### ABILITY_DRIZZLE (141 chars)
"Summons rain on entry lasting 8 turns. Rain boosts Water moves by 50% and reduces Fire moves by 50%. Thunder and Hurricane gain perfect accuracy."

### ABILITY_INTIMIDATE (159 chars)  
"Lowers all foes' Attack by one stage on entry. Blocked by Clear Body, Hyper Cutter, and Inner Focus. In doubles, affects both opposing Pokemon at once."

### ABILITY_HUGE_POWER (164 chars)
"Doubles the Pokemon's Attack stat after all other modifiers. This effectively doubles physical damage output. The boost applies to the final calculated stat."

### ABILITY_BATTLE_ARMOR (Elite Redux) (172 chars)
"Completely immune to critical hits. Also reduces all direct damage by 20%. The damage reduction doesn't apply to weather, status conditions, or entry hazards damage."
