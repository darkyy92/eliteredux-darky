## Abilities

### ABILITY_ADAPTABILITY
Extended: "Increases the power of moves that match the user's type by 33% instead of the usual 50% STAB bonus. This results in a 2x multiplier for same-type moves."

### ABILITY_AERILATE
Extended: "Normal-type moves become Flying-type and receive a 20% power boost. This allows Normal moves to benefit from STAB and hit through immunities."
