# Extended Descriptions with Empty Lines for Readability

With 11 usable lines (280-300 char limit), we can use a few empty lines to improve readability!

## Format Examples

### ABILITY_DRIZZLE (with empty line)
```
Summons rain for 8 turns when this Pokemon enters battle.

Rain boosts Water-type moves by 50% and reduces Fire-type moves by 50%. Thunder and Hurricane never miss during rain.
```

### ABILITY_INTIMIDATE (structured format)
```
Lowers all opposing Pokemon's Attack by one stage when this Pokemon enters battle.

Blocked by: Clear Body, White Smoke, Hyper Cutter, Full Metal Body, Inner Focus, Own Tempo, Oblivious, and Scrappy.

In Double Battles, affects both opponents simultaneously.
```

### ABILITY_HUGE_POWER (technical details)
```
Doubles this Pokemon's Attack stat.

The boost applies after all other stat modifiers, effectively doubling physical damage output. Works with the final calculated Attack value, not the base stat.

Can be copied by Trace and Role Play.
```

### ABILITY_BATTLE_ARMOR (Elite Redux - detailed)
```
Provides complete immunity to critical hits from any source.

Additionally reduces all direct damage by 20%. This reduction applies only to damaging moves, not to indirect damage from:
- Weather conditions
- Status ailments
- Entry hazards
- Recoil damage

Stacks multiplicatively with other damage reduction effects.
```

## Formatting Guidelines

1. **Main effect** - First 1-2 lines
2. **Empty line** - Visual separator
3. **Details/mechanics** - Next 2-4 lines
4. **Empty line** - If more sections needed
5. **Interactions/exceptions** - Final section
