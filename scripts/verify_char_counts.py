    33: "Swift Swim boosts the Pok√©mon's Speed by 50% during rain weather. Works with all forms of rain including regular rain, heavy rain, and Primordial Sea. The speed boost applies immediately when rain is active and disappears when rain ends. Stacks with other speed modifiers for powerful sweeping potential.",
    
    34: "Chlorophyll harnesses solar energy to boost Speed by 50% in harsh sunlight. Works with all sun forms: regular (8 turns), permanent (Drought), and primal (Desolate Land). This ability excels in sun teams, enabling fast Solar Beam sweeps and outpacing threats. Pairs perfectly with Drought setters.",
    
    35: "Illuminate increases the accuracy of all moves used by the Pok√©mon by 20% (1.2x multiplier). Additionally, when this Pok√©mon is in the lead position of your party while exploring, it doubles the wild encounter rate, making it easier to find wild Pok√©mon in tall grass, caves, and water.",
    
    36: "Trace copies the ability of an opposing Pok√©mon when entering battle, replacing itself in the current ability slot. Cannot copy Trace, Wonder Guard, Receiver, or any persistent/unsuppressable abilities. In doubles, targets the first valid opponent. Does not copy innate abilities. Shows ability popup for copied ability.",
    
    37: "Huge Power doubles the Pok√©mon's Attack stat before stat stage modifiers are applied. This multiplies the effective Attack by 2.0x, making physical moves significantly more powerful. Works with stat stages, items, and other modifiers that are applied after. Identical effect to Pure Power.",
    
    38: "Poison Point has a 30% chance to poison opponents when making or receiving contact moves. Works both defensively when attacked with contact moves and offensively when using contact moves. The poison inflicts 1/8 max HP damage each turn. Bypasses Safeguard protection when triggered by ability.",
    
    39: "Inner Focus provides immunity to flinching, Intimidate-like effects (Intimidate, Scare, Fearmonger, etc.), and status conditions from Taunt. Additionally, when this Pok√©mon uses Focus Blast, it bypasses accuracy checks and always hits the target, improving its reliability.",
    
    40: "Magma Armor grants complete immunity to the frostbite status condition and reduces damage from Water and Ice-type moves by 30%. This defensive ability is particularly effective against Ice-type Pokemon and moves that inflict frostbite. The resistance helps mitigate common weaknesses.",
    
    41: "Water Veil prevents burn status completely and automatically casts Aqua Ring upon entering battle. The Aqua Ring effect heals 1/16 max HP each turn. Big Root boosts healing by 50%. The healing stacks with other recovery effects and continues until the Pok√©mon switches out or faints.",
    
    42: "Magnet Pull prevents Steel-type Pok√©mon from switching out or fleeing from battle. Ghost-type Pok√©mon are immune to this trapping effect. Pok√©mon holding Shed Shell can still escape. Does not affect Teleport, U-turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass moves."
