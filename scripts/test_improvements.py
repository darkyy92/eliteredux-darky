CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST create the markdown file at eliteredux-darky/knowledge/abilities/{id}_{name_lowercase}.md using the Write tool
2. Extended description must be EXACTLY 280-300 characters INCLUDING SPACES
3. Count characters before finalizing: use len("your description here")
4. Reference examples: Check 15_drizzle.md, 33_swift_swim.md for format

CHARACTER COUNT VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Extended description written
- [ ] Character count calculated: len("description")
- [ ] Count is between 280-300 (inclusive)
- [ ] If not, revise description until it fits
- [ ] Add *Character count: X* line in file

QUALITY EXAMPLES (exactly 280-300 chars):
"Swift Swim boosts the Pokémon's Speed by 50% during rain weather. Works with all forms of rain including regular rain, heavy rain, and Primordial Sea. The speed boost applies immediately when rain is active and disappears when rain ends. Stacks with other speed modifiers for sweeping potential." (295 chars)

Follow the mandatory file structure exactly like 15_drizzle.md with all required sections.
