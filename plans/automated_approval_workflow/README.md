# Automated Approval Workflow Plans

This directory contains planning documents for automating the Elite Redux Ability Codex approval workflow.

## Main Documents

- **[codex_ability_approval_automation.md](codex_ability_approval_automation.md)** - Master plan for eliminating GitHub issue friction and implementing direct approval automation

## Overview

Transform the manual, GitHub-issue-based approval process into an automated system where:
- Users can directly approve abilities with a single click
- Minor edits are saved automatically without GitHub issues
- All downstream files (progress.md, status API, extended_descriptions.txt) regenerate automatically
- GitHub issues only remain for complex disputes requiring maintainer judgment

## Status

ðŸš§ **Planning Phase** - Ready to begin implementation
