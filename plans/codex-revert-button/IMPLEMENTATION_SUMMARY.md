# Implementation Summary: Red "Not Done Yet" Button

## What Was Implemented

Successfully added a red "Not Done Yet" button to the Codex that allows users to revert ability approvals. The implementation leverages the existing real-time update infrastructure for seamless multi-user support.

## Changes Made

### 1. InlineAbilityEditor.vue

#### Added UI Elements:
- Red "Not Done Yet" button that appears when ability is approved (replaces green approve button)
- Revert confirmation modal with clear messaging about consequences
- Button shows "Reverting..." during operation

#### Added State Variables:
```javascript
const reverting = ref(false)
const revertModalOpen = ref(false)
```

#### Added Computed Message:
```javascript
const revertModalMessage = computed(() => {
  return `Are you sure you want to revert the approval for "${abilityInfo.value.name}" (ID: ${abilityInfo.value.id})?

This will:
â€¢ Mark it as needing review again
â€¢ Remove it from approved abilities
â€¢ Update all connected users instantly

Current status: Approved âœ… â†’ Needs Review ðŸŸ `
})
```

#### Added Core Functions:
1. `revertApproval()` - Shows the confirmation modal
2. `handleRevertConfirm()` - Handles the revert process:
   - Applies optimistic update immediately
   - Shows 5-second undo toast
   - Fetches current file from GitHub
   - Updates frontmatter status from "reviewed" to "written"
   - Commits changes to GitHub
   - Handles errors by reverting optimistic update

#### Added Modal Component:
```vue
<Modal
  v-model:isOpen="revertModalOpen"
  title="Revert Ability Approval"
  :message="revertModalMessage"
  confirmText="Revert Approval"
  cancelText="Cancel"
  :danger="true"
  @confirm="handleRevertConfirm"
  @cancel="revertModalOpen = false"
/>
```

### 2. CSS Styling

Added comprehensive styling for the danger button:
```css
.editor-button.danger {
  background: #e53e3e;
  color: white;
  border-color: #e53e3e;
}

.editor-button.danger:hover:not(:disabled) {
  background: #c53030;
  border-color: #c53030;
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(229, 62, 62, 0.3);
}

.editor-button.danger:active:not(:disabled) {
  transform: translateY(0);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(229, 62, 62, 0.2);
}

.editor-button.danger:disabled {
  background: #feb2b2;
  border-color: #feb2b2;
}
```

## How It Works

### User Experience:
1. User sees approved ability with green checkmark (âœ…)
2. Clicks red "Not Done Yet" button
3. Confirmation modal appears explaining the consequences
4. User confirms â†’ 5-second undo toast appears
5. UI immediately updates to show orange dot (ðŸŸ )
6. Can press 'Z' within 5 seconds to cancel
7. After 5 seconds, GitHub API call executes
8. All connected users see the update within 2-5 seconds

### Technical Flow:
1. **Optimistic Update**: Immediately updates local state via `updateAbilityStatus()`
2. **Undo Window**: Uses `showUndoableSuccess()` to delay actual API call
3. **GitHub API**: Updates frontmatter in the ability markdown file
4. **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automatically regenerates all status files
5. **Real-Time Sync**: Polling system propagates changes to all users
6. **Error Handling**: Reverts optimistic update if API call fails

## Integration with Existing Systems

The implementation seamlessly integrates with:
- **Undo Feature**: 5-second window to cancel the revert
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes sync to all users within seconds
- **Multi-User Support**: Activity indicators show when others make changes
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatically triggers file regeneration
- **Error Recovery**: Optimistic updates revert on failure

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Testing:
1. Navigate to an approved ability (has green checkmark)
2. Verify red "Not Done Yet" button appears
3. Click the button and verify modal appears
4. Cancel and verify nothing changes
5. Click again and confirm
6. Verify undo toast appears for 5 seconds
7. Let it complete and verify status changes to orange dot

### Undo Testing:
1. Start a revert
2. Press 'Z' within 5 seconds
3. Verify "Action cancelled" message
4. Verify status remains approved

### Multi-User Testing:
1. Open Codex in two browsers
2. Revert an ability in Browser A
3. Verify Browser B shows the update within 5 seconds
4. Check for "Other users active" indicator

### Error Testing:
1. Start a revert
2. Disconnect network before 5 seconds
3. Verify error message appears
4. Verify status reverts to approved

## Debugging Improvements Added

After initial implementation, we discovered issues with button visibility and added:

1. **Enhanced ID Extraction**: Improved `updateAbilityInfo()` to better extract ability IDs from filenames
2. **Loading State**: Added "Loading ability status..." indicator when data isn't ready
3. **Debug Button**: Added debug button (dev mode only) to troubleshoot status issues
4. **Better Logging**: Enhanced console logging to track status loading
5. **String ID Handling**: Ensured IDs are converted to strings for store lookups
6. **Status Watchers**: Added watchers to react when ability status updates

### Debug Instructions

If buttons aren't showing:
1. Click the "Debug" button (in dev mode)
2. Check console for ability ID extraction
3. Verify status is loaded from store
4. Check if GitHub token is available

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Consider these future enhancements:
1. Add audit logging to track who reverted and when
2. Add optional reason field for reverts
3. Add bulk revert functionality
4. Add email/Discord notifications for reverts
